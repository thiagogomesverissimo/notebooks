# Memorandum Data Analysis for a Pizza Company

Our Pizza Company Name: Brazilian Pizza Inc.
Our Pizza Company Name Competitor: Br Pizza Inc.

Variables to be collected:

## A survey should be created with the following questions:

0. Gender: male, female, other
1. Age: Integer Number
2. Food quality: From 1 to 5
3. Service quality: From 1 to 5
4. Ambience: From 1 to 5
5. How did you learn from us: friends, TV, internet social networks, local newspaper, other
6. Would you use a delivery system from us? Yes or No
7. Pizza flavor preferred: choose from catalog
8. Recommend this company to a friend: Yes or No

A good idea is to provide a discount coupon for the client who respond the questionnaire.

## Analyses

The best approach here is to use some facet graphical mixing the categorical variables.

- A barplot with grades for food, service and ambience quality, grouped by gender.
- A age distribution to evaluate our client age format distribution. Boxplot too.
- Barplot with flavors in percentage
- To predict if a delivery system would be good, a facet graph with quality grades by "Would you use a delivery system from us".
- A facet graph with quality grades by "Recommend this company to a friend"
- Pie chart with: "How did you learn from" sources. To discover what media is better to invest

,The Current Landscape of Research and Practice on Visualizations and Dashboards for Learning Analytics,"Liu, Min and Han, Songhee and Shao, Peixia and Cai, Ying and Pan, Zilong",,2021,OpenAlex,23--46,,"While the research on learning analytics (LA) has increased rapidly in recent years, many inquiries remain insufficiently answered including how to effectively visualize data to better promote teaching and learning. First, this chapter provides a systematic literature review on the current research and practice of using visualizations as an analytic technique in LA research and explores the practice of dashboard designs as a means to communicate the research findings to stakeholders. The findings of this review show researchers use visualization or dashboard as a research methodology for analytical purposes and to enlighten their inquiry processes in research, while instructors and learners use it as a means of communication tools to inform about their educational practices. This chapter also describes a case study that uses visualization as a research tool to analyze data and communicate research findings and provides examples of designing a dashboard for teachers to support their teaching. This case illustrates an example of how visualizations and a dashboard are used in research and practice in support of the review conducted.",Book Section,10.1007/978-3-030-81222-5\_2,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-81222-5\_2,,,Dashboard | Learning Analytics | Information Visualization | Visual Analytics | Interactive Visualization | Graph Visualization,Springer International Publishing,2662-2122,,,,"45588,9518055556","45598,6462384259",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Accepted,

towards student-focused dashboards. These dashboards are informed by
theory-oriented frameworks, designed to incorporate affordances that

,"A shared lens around sensemaking in learning analytics: What activity theory, definition of a situation and affordances can offer","Poquet, Oleksandra",British Journal of Educational Technology,2024,wiley,1811-1831,55,"Abstract The paper argues that learning analytics as a research field can benefit from a theory-informed shared language to describe sensemaking of learning and teaching data. To make the case for such shared language, first, I critically review prominent sensemaking theories to then demonstrate how studies in learning analytics do not use coherent descriptions of sensemaking, eclectically combining the paradigms that have underlying differences. I then propose a conceptualization of sensemaking that overcomes the differences between these theories and explains how the concepts of activity system, the definition of the situation and affordances can be used to capture individual differences in sensemaking. The paper concludes with a preliminary framework and examples demonstrating its utility in raising new theoretical questions, informing design principles and providing shared language for researchers in learning analytics.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Sensemaking happens when individuals try to explain unknown situations. Learning analytics uses sensemaking as a lens to understand dashboard use. Systematic analysis of sensemaking is essential for learning analytics. What this paper adds The paper notes that noticing and perceiving are commonly examined in learning analytics on dashboard use. The paper suggests a revision of fundamental assumptions in sensemaking. A paper proposes a toy model of sensemaking that includes operationalization of the definition of the situation, activity where sensemaking happens and processes of noticing and perceiving affordances. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics must examine sensemaking of data about teaching and learning in a systematic manner. Internal perceptions of the social environment and activity that are informed by the data need to be considered in evaluating dashboard use.",,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13435,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjet.13435,,,"activity theory, definition of a situation, ecological perception theory, information elaboration, learning analytics, sensemaking",,,,,É um estudo primário sobre LA e não sobre LAD,"45598,5941087963","45598,6343981482",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

Objective: The paper reviews the current research on intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call model-based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision making. Methods: Using a systematic literature review methodology, we first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for teachers and learners. Results and Conclusions: A majority of papers used either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with theory-driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that model-based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact on learning and decision making by teachers and students.

Putra,Digital Chemical Engineering,2022,Elsevier Science Direct,100044,4,"Process simulation is used to develop a digital twin representation of chemical processes typically for process optimization or what-if scenarios. However, it is known to be computationally expensive and there is an increasing need for process remote monitoring and optimization. This is where machine learning models shine, where they can run up to several orders of magnitude faster than their equivalent first principle process simulation models. Most of the previous work in this area tend to demonstrate the ability of machine learning models to accurately capture complex, non-linear relationships between process parameters in various chemical processes. Two important aspects are rarely discussed, namely the construction of machine learning models using operating data and the deployment of these models. In this paper, we address these two aspects and review the different information silos in industrial settings that need to be considered when working with hybrid models (combining process simulation and machine learning). This is illustrated by a case study for an operating natural gas dehydration unit, covering data management, process simulation, machine learning and visualization. We demonstrate how the hybrid models can be constructed and packaged as an online monitoring and a prediction dashboard. Several unique challenges are also highlighted including the reliability of field data and operational deviations due to operability and controllability - all of which need to be understood in order to successfully translate operating systems to process simulation and machine learning models that are reliable and accurate.

The ASH Research Collaborative is a nonprofit organization established through the American Society of Hematology's commitment to patients with hematologic conditions and the science that informs clinical care and future therapies. The ASH Research Collaborative houses 2 major initiatives: (1) the Data Hub and (2) the Clinical Trials Network (CTN). The Data Hub is a program for hematologic diseases in which networks of clinical care delivery sites are developed in specific disease areas, with individual patient data contributed through electronic health record (EHR) integration, direct data entry through electronic data capture, and external data sources. Disease-specific data models are constructed so that data can be assembled into analytic datasets and used to enhance clinical care through dashboards and other mechanisms. Initial models have been built in multiple myeloma (MM) and sickle cell disease (SCD) using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. The Data Hub also provides a framework for development of disease-specific learning communities (LC) and testing of health care delivery strategies. The ASH Research Collaborative SCD CTN is a clinical trials accelerator that creates efficiencies in the execution of multicenter clinical trials and has been initially developed for SCD. Both components are operational, with the Data Hub actively aggregating source data and the SCD CTN reviewing study candidates.

,Lessons Learned from Nanbar Health: Developing a Multi-System Software Suite for Predictive Algorithms and Remote Monitoring for People Living with Sickle Cell Disease,Arvind Mallikarjunan and Elizabeth Hensley and Abhinav Gundala and Jhana Parikh and Olivia Fernandez and Kumar Utkarsh and Caroline Vuong and Shannon Ford and Nirmish Shah,Blood,2023,Elsevier Science Direct,5308,142,"Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that alters the shape of red blood cells, leading to significant complications and requiring highly complex care. Efforts often focus on prevention and early diagnosis of pain to improve outcomes for those with SCD. Remote monitoring (RPM) and predictive algorithms has grown exponentially in the last decade as a support tool for managing chronic diseases like heart failure and diabetes. Implementing similar technology for SCD care could improve patient outcomes through early detection of complications and providing physicians with longitudinal data to support clinical decisions. Our team previously used mobile health (mHealth) as RPM in this population and developed a machine learning algorithm to predict pain scores with 86% accuracy. Here, we describe the development process for the Nanbar Health software alongside the lessons learned from its development. Objectives: Describe the methods necessary to build a comprehensive mHealth remote monitoring system (Nanbar Health) that facilitates SCD health management.Develop a set of lessons for other developers when building a remote monitoring software suite. Methods: Nanbar Health's development process has taken 2 years. First, our team reviewed feedback and “bug” reports from patients and providers of other mobile applications our team built at Duke University. Using the feedback collected an user-interface (UI) interface (mock-ups) was created for the Nanbar Health mobile app using Figma. These mock-ups were then shown to healthcare providers with expertise in caring for individuals with SCD for feedback. Upon approval of mock-ups, our team developed the mobile application using Swift and Apple HealthKit. The team also built a physician-facing dashboard using React, NodeJS, and Python. The backend software for this system utilized Docker containers mounted on AWS EC2 instances, a Parse server, MongoDB and PostgreSQL databases, and Nginx for deployment and load balancing. Next, the dashboard was reviewed by medical providers for feedback. The analytics portion of the dashboard processed data in Python backend scripts and interactive visualizations were built using the Plotly library in NodeJS. The analytics portion of the tool is currently being reviewed for feedback. Throughout the process of developing and piloting the Nanbar Health Software, our team identified several challenges. These challenges were collected into a comprehensive index named, “Lessons Learned”. Results: The lessons learned include: 1. Overall Gain user feedback and place yourself in the shoes of the user: At every step of your software's development ensure you are continuously getting feedback from your users. 2. Mobile Application Engagement is key to acquiring good data: Ensure your team uses a variety of methods methods to engage your users.No mobile app is one size fits all, but one app can customize to all: The development team should create re-usable, dynamic components wherever possible. 3. Provider Dashboard Testing to build: Developers should build a user interface that is easy to run and test as a “pseudo-user” while they are building it, making it easier for the developer to understand the user experience and build a user-friendly application.Building to test: Plan for beta testers from the beginning and ensure that they have access to continuously-updated and fake but realistic data. 4. Network Analysis Complex analytics are computationally demanding - Advanced analytical tools incur more complications when incorporated into a High-Usage SystemFor heavy data processing, go serverless - Isolating heavy data processing from the rest of the application saves tremendous time and money. 5.

New tools such as educational games offer promising advantages: they can personalize feedback to students and save educators time by automating the assessment process. However, while many teachers agree that educational games increase motivation, learning, and retention, few are ready to fully trust them as an assessment tool. A likely reason behind this lack of trust is that educational games are distributed as black boxes, unmodifiable by educators and not providing enough insight about the gameplay. This chapter presents three systematic literature reviews looking into the integration of assessment, feedback, and learning analytics in educational games. It then proposes a framework and present a fully developed engine. The engine is used by both developers and educators.

Recently, learning analytics (LA) has demonstrated its potential in promoting agency, as it enables students to take an active role in their learning process and supports the development of their self-regulatory skills. Despite the growing interest and potential for supporting student agency, there have yet to be any studies reviewing the extant works dealing with the use of LA in supporting student agency. We systematically reviewed the existing related works in eight major international databases and identified 15 articles. Analysis of these articles revealed that most of the studies aimed to investigate student or educators’ agency experiences, propose design principles for LA, and to a lesser extent, develop LA methods/dashboards to support agency. Of those studies developing LA, none initially explored student agency experiences and then utilized their findings to develop evidence-based LA methods and dashboards for supporting student agency. Moreover, we found that the included articles largely rely on descriptive and diagnostic analytics, paying less attention to predictive analytics and completely overlooking the potential of prescriptive learning analytics in supporting agency. Our findings also shed light on nine key design elements for effective LA support of student agency, including customization, decision-making support, consideration of transparency and privacy, and facilitation of co-design. Surprisingly, we found that no studies have considered the use of LA to support student agency in K–12 education, while higher education has been the focal point of the LA community. Finally, we highlighted the fields of study and data visualization types that the studies mostly targeted and, more importantly, identified eight crucial challenges facing LA in its support of student agency.",Journal Article,10.3390/su151813662,https://doi.org/10.3390/su151813662,,,Learning Analytics | Student Performance Prediction | Student Engagement | Data-driven Education | Online Learning,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,2071-1050,,,"É uma revisão sistemática em Learning Analytics, mas não focada apenas em LAD","45588,9518055556","45593,059837963",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

One of the practical implications of this research for learning analytics stakeholders, such as educators, policymakers, and researchers, is the ability to use these technologies tools to enhance teaching and learning. By utilizing these tools, policymakers can learn information that can be applied to the development of strategies and policies relating to the integration of technology in education. Researchers can utilize these tools to generate data that will aid in the study of teaching and learning, which will lead to the development of new teaching strategies and technological advancements.

into the ones related to teacher practices, such as awareness and
reflection, learning orchestration, or assessment frameworks, and the
ones related to the technology used to open up the models to teachers,
such as dashboards or adaptive learning architectures. Moreover, results
show that research in MbLA has taken an individualistic approach to
student learning and instruction, neglecting social aspects and elements
of collaborative learning. To advance research in MbLA, future research
should focus on hybrid teacher-AI approaches that foster the partnership

Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where teacher guidance is scarce, and
learners must engage in their learning process trying to succeed and

difficult for learners given the autonomy that is required in this kind
of courses. In order to support learners on this process, researchers
have proposed a variety of tools designed to support certain aspects of
self-regulation in online learning environments. Nevertheless, there is
a lack of study to understand what the commonalities and differences in
terms of design are, what the results in terms of the effect on
learners' self-regulation are and which of them could be applied in
MOOCs. Those are the questions that should be further explored. In this
paper we present a systematic literature review where 22 tools designed
to support SRL in online environments were analyzed. Our findings
indicate that: (1) most of the studies do not evaluate the effect on
learners' SRL strategies; (2) the use of interactive visualizations has
a positive effect on learners' motivation; (3) the use of the social
comparison component has a positive effect on engagement and time

Researchers are increasingly interested in using physiological data, such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), as an objective tool to measure bodily reactions during collaborative activities. However, it remains unclear how physiological data can contribute to our understanding, monitoring and support of the collaborative learning process. To address this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing on the contribution of physiological data to collaborative learning, the features of physiological data that correlate with effective outcomes, and interventions designed to support collaboration based on physiological data. The review identified 13 relevant publications that revealed physiological data can indeed be useful for detecting certain aspects of collaboration including students’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective (emotion and motivation) states. Physiological arousal in the form of EDA peaks and physiological synchrony (interdependence or associated activity between individuals’ physiological signals) were the most commonly used features. Surprisingly, only one publication presented a prototype of a learning analytics dashboard that used physiological data to guide student reflections. Furthermore, the review highlights the potential for integrating physiological measures with other data sources, such as speech, eye gaze, and facial expression, to uncover psychophysiological reactions and accompanying social and contextual processes related to collaborative learning.

The review is then guided by an interest in whether these dashboards are still primarily analytics-driven or if they have become pedagogically informed over time. By mapping the identified themes of technological maturity, informing frameworks, affordances, data sources, and analytical levels over publications per year, the review identifies an emerging trajectory towards student-focused dashboards. These dashboards are informed by theory-oriented frameworks, designed to incorporate affordances that supporting student learning, and realised through integration of more than just activity data from learning management systems – allowing the dashboards to better support students' learnings processes.

Visualizations showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing learning difficulties. While LADs have gained popularity, existing LADs are still far behind when it comes to employing predictive analytics into their designs. Our systematic literature review has revealed limitations in the utilization of predictive analytics tools among existing LADs. We find that studies leveraging predictive analytics only go as far as identifying the at-risk students and do not employ model interpretation or explainability capabilities. This limits the ability of LADs to offer data-driven prescriptive advice to students that can offer them guidance on appropriate learning adjustments. Further, published studies have mostly described LADs that are still at prototype stages; hence, robust evaluations of how LADs affect student outcomes have not yet been conducted. The evaluations until now are limited to LAD functionalities and usability rather than their effectiveness as a pedagogical treatment. We conclude by making recommendations for the design of advanced dashboards that more fully take advantage of machine learning technologies, while using suitable visualizations to project only relevant information.

This paper presents a systematic review that follows the PRISMA statement and analyzes the adaptation features of LADs and their potential effects on learning. 24 of the 462 articles retrieved were scrutinized using an analysis framework centered on adaptation. The main finding is that there is more evidence of adaptable LADs than adaptive LADs, suggesting that adaptivity is worth exploring. The results mainly highlight 3 common LADs adaptable capabilities - most of which offer data exploration features - and 2 adaptive ones that change or refresh indicators on dashboards. Only a few articles investigate the adaptation of indicator visualizations or organization on dashboards. Currently, there is no work on the use of advanced computing techniques such as machine learning for LADs adaptation. Additionally, only 5 articles provide some evidence of dashboards adaptation features evaluation. As a result, a preliminary research agenda on LADs adaptation is suggested for enhancing LADs adoption and utility. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Conference paper,10.1007/978-3-031-72315-5_3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205111148&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-72315-5_3&partnerID=40&md5=8ccfeed1b8d2675445a8eb2205cb6a63,,Adaptation; Learning Analytics Dashboards; Learning Indicators; Systematic Review,Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Adaptation; Adaptive learning; Adaptivity; Analysis frameworks; Computing techniques; Data exploration; Learning analytic dashboard; Learning indicator; Potential effects; Systematic Review; Adversarial machine learning,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,03029743,English,"Cited by: 0; Conference name: 19th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2024; Conference date: 16 September 2024 through 20 September 2024; Conference code: 319189",,"45588,9519212963","45588,9519212963",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

,"A checklist to guide the planning, designing, implementation, and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards","Kaliisa, Rogers and Jivet, Ioana and Prinsloo, Paul",International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,2023,Scopus,,20,"Higher education institutions are moving to design and implement teacher-facing learning analytics (LA) dashboards with the hope that instructors can extract deep insights about student learning and make informed decisions to improve their teaching. While much attention has been paid to developing teacher-facing dashboards, less is known about how they are designed, implemented and evaluated. This paper presents a systematic literature review of existing studies reporting on teacher-facing LA dashboards. Out of the 1968 articles retrieved from several databases, 50 articles were included in the final analysis. Guided by several frameworks, articles were coded based on the following dimensions: purpose, theoretical grounding, stakeholder involvement, ethics and privacy, design, implementation, and evaluation criteria. The findings show that most dashboards are designed to increase teachers’ awareness but with limited actionable insights to allow intervention. Moreover, while teachers are involved in the design process, this is mainly at the exploratory/problem definition stage, with little input beyond this stage. Most dashboards were prescriptive, less customisable, and implicit about the theoretical constructs behind their designs. In addition, dashboards are deployed at prototype and pilot stages, and the evaluation is dominated by self-reports and users’ reactions with limited focus on changes to teaching and learning. Besides, only one study considered privacy as a design requirement. Based on the findings of the study and synthesis of existing literature, we propose a four-dimensional checklist for planning, designing, implementing and evaluating LA dashboards. © 2023, The Author(s).",Review,10.1186/s41239-023-00394-6,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85158003907&doi=10.1186%2fs41239-023-00394-6&partnerID=40&md5=106b2f915d5f20a8a0304cccc10e6753,,Dashboard evaluation; Learning analytics; Systematic review; Teacher-facing dashboards,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,23659440,English,"Cited by: 16; All Open Access, Gold Open Access",,"45588,9519212963","45588,9519212963",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

Objective: The paper reviews the current research on intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call model-based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision making. Methods: Using a systematic literature review methodology, we first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for teachers and learners. Results and Conclusions: A majority of papers used either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with theory-driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that model-based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact on learning and decision making by teachers and students. We offer a taxonomy of knowledge models that can serve as a starting point for designing such interaction. © 2023 The Authors.

,Staying on target: A systematic literature review on learner-facing learning analytics dashboards,"Valle, Natercia and Antonenko, Pavlo and Dawson, Kara and Huggins-Manley, Anne Corinne",British Journal of Educational Technology,2021,Scopus,1724 – 1748,52,"The advances in technology to capture and process unprecedented amounts of educational data has boosted the interest in Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) applications as a way to provide meaningful visual information to administrators, parents, teachers and learners. Despite the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is known about LADs’ theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing LAD’s target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15 databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between LADs’ intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation from this study is that LADs’ target outcomes should guide the selection of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to inform future endeavours in the field. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There has been an increased interest and investment in learning analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users. Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence learners’ behaviour, achievement and skills. What this paper adds This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning analytics dashboard studies. The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics dashboards. Implications for practice and/or policy Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important target outcome). The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards. The paper also highlights the need for further integration between learner-facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.",Review,10.1111/bjet.13089,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105201830&doi=10.1111%2fbjet.13089&partnerID=40&md5=52b5f2b1d1986f68fd04d2b9c868df6e,,evaluation; learning analytics dashboards; systematic literature review; target outcomes,Alignment; Facings; Motivation; Affective measures; Cognitive domain; Open learner models; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Self-regulated learning; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Visual information; Learning systems,Blackwell Publishing Ltd,00071013,English,Cited by: 43,,"45588,9519212963","45588,9519212963",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

However, developing SRL strategies is difficult for learners given the autonomy that is required in this kind of courses. In order to support learners on this process, researchers have proposed a variety of tools designed to support certain aspects of self-regulation in online learning environments. Nevertheless, there is a lack of study to understand what the commonalities and differences in terms of design are, what the results in terms of the effect on learners’ self-regulation are and which of them could be applied in MOOCs. Those are the questions that should be further explored. In this paper we present a systematic literature review where 22 tools designed to support SRL in online environments were analyzed. Our findings indicate that: (1) most of the studies do not evaluate the effect on learners’ SRL strategies; (2) the use of interactive visualizations has a positive effect on learners’ motivation; (3) the use of the social comparison component has a positive effect on engagement and time management; and (4) there is a lack of models to match learners’ activity with the tools with SRL strategies. Finally, we present the lessons learned for guiding the community in the implementation of tools to support SRL strategies in MOOCs. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference paper,10.1007/978-3-319-98572-5_2,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053175970&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-98572-5_2&partnerID=40&md5=78564dd16be2591661e019ed0b1938e7,,Dashboard; Learning analytics; Literature review; Massive Open Online Courses; MOOC; Online; Self-Regulated Learning; System; Tools,Computer aided instruction; Curricula; Deregulation; Engineering education; Learning systems; Teaching; Tools; Visualization; Dashboard; Learning analytics; Literature reviews; Massive open online course; MOOC; Online; Self-regulated learning; System; E-learning,Springer Verlag,03029743,English,"Cited by: 54; Conference name: 13th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2018; Conference date: 3 September 2018 through 6 September 2018; Conference code: 217579",,"45588,9519212963","45588,9519212963",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

This is achieved through systems that make their models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers. We use bibliometric network analysis and topic modelling to explore the synergies between the related research groups and the main research topics considered in the 42 reviewed papers. Network analysis depicts an early stage community, made up of several research groups, mainly from the fields of learning analytics and intelligent tutoring systems, which have had little explicit and implicit collaboration but do share a common core literature. Th resulting topics from the topic modelling can be grouped into the ones related to teacher practices, such as awareness and reflection, learning orchestration, or assessment frameworks, and the ones related to the technology used to open up the models to teachers, such as dashboards or adaptive learning architectures.

,Learning Analytics in Supporting Student Agency: A Systematic Review,"Hooshyar, Danial and Tammets, Kairit and Ley, Tobias and Aus, Kati and Kollom, Kaire",Sustainability (Switzerland),2023,Scopus,,15,"Student agency, or agency for learning, refers to an individual’s ability to act and cause changes during the learning process. Recently, learning analytics (LA) has demonstrated its potential in promoting agency, as it enables students to take an active role in their learning process and supports the development of their self-regulatory skills. Despite the growing interest and potential for supporting student agency, there have yet to be any studies reviewing the extant works dealing with the use of LA in supporting student agency. We systematically reviewed the existing related works in eight major international databases and identified 15 articles. Analysis of these articles revealed that most of the studies aimed to investigate student or educators’ agency experiences, propose design principles for LA, and to a lesser extent, develop LA methods/dashboards to support agency. Of those studies developing LA, none initially explored student agency experiences and then utilized their findings to develop evidence-based LA methods and dashboards for supporting student agency. Moreover, we found that the included articles largely rely on descriptive and diagnostic analytics, paying less attention to predictive analytics and completely overlooking the potential of prescriptive learning analytics in supporting agency. Our findings also shed light on nine key design elements for effective LA support of student agency, including customization, decision-making support, consideration of transparency and privacy, and facilitation of co-design. Surprisingly, we found that no studies have considered the use of LA to support student agency in K–12 education, while higher education has been the focal point of the LA community. Finally, we highlighted the fields of study and data visualization types that the studies mostly targeted and, more importantly, identified eight crucial challenges facing LA in its support of student agency. © 2023 by the authors.",Review,10.3390/su151813662,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85173036349&doi=10.3390%2fsu151813662&partnerID=40&md5=c6e67c3fdc5dcf81077ccd2bf6c01291,,learning analytics; student agency; systematic review; technology-enhanced learning,decision support system; facilitation; higher education; learning; student; visualization,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),20711050,English,"Cited by: 6; All Open Access, Gold Open Access",,"45588,9519212963","45588,9519212963",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

Network analysis depicts an early stage community, made up of several research groups, mainly from the fields of learning analytics and intelligent tutoring systems, which have had little explicit and implicit collaboration but do share a common core literature. Th resulting topics from the topic modelling can be grouped into the ones related to teacher practices, such as awareness and reflection, learning orchestration, or assessment frameworks, and the ones related to the technology used to open up the models to teachers, such as dashboards or adaptive learning architectures.

,Is it time we get real? A systematic review of the potential of data-driven technologies to address teachers' implicit biases,"Gauthier, A. and Rizvi, Saman and Cukurova, Mutlu and Mavrikis, Manolis",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,2022,OpenAlex,,5,"Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.",Journal Article,10.3389/frai.2022.994967,https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2022.994967,,,Data-driven Education | Educational Data Mining | Learning Analytics | Virtual Teaching | E-Learning | Emerging technologies,Frontiers Media,2624-8212,,,,"45588,9518055556","45588,9518055556",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels.

Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues.

,Use of Predictive Analytics within Learning Analytics Dashboards: A Review of Case Studies,"Ramaswami, Gomathy and Sušnjak, Teo and Mathrani, Anuradha and Umer, Rahila",Technology Knowledge and Learning,2022,OpenAlex,959--980,28,"Abstract Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) provide educators and students with a comprehensive snapshot of the learning domain. Visualizations showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing learning difficulties. While LADs have gained popularity, existing LADs are still far behind when it comes to employing predictive analytics into their designs. Our systematic literature review has revealed limitations in the utilization of predictive analytics tools among existing LADs. We find that studies leveraging predictive analytics only go as far as identifying the at-risk students and do not employ model interpretation or explainability capabilities. This limits the ability of LADs to offer data-driven prescriptive advice to students that can offer them guidance on appropriate learning adjustments. Further, published studies have mostly described LADs that are still at prototype stages; hence, robust evaluations of how LADs affect student outcomes have not yet been conducted. The evaluations until now are limited to LAD functionalities and usability rather than their effectiveness as a pedagogical treatment. We conclude by making recommendations for the design of advanced dashboards that more fully take advantage of machine learning technologies, while using suitable visualizations to project only relevant information. Finally, we stress the importance of developing dashboards that are ultimately evaluated for their effectiveness.",Journal Article,10.1007/s10758-022-09613-x,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10758-022-09613-x,,,Popularity | Learning Analytics | Predictive analytics | Predictive Analysis | Data-driven Education | Student Performance Prediction | Meta-Learning,Springer Science+Business Media,2211-1662,,,,"45588,9518055556","45588,9518055556",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

While much attention has been paid to developing teacher-facing dashboards, less is known about how they are designed, implemented and evaluated. This paper presents a systematic literature review of existing studies reporting on teacher-facing LA dashboards. Out of the 1968 articles retrieved from several databases, 50 articles were included in the final analysis. Guided by several frameworks, articles were coded based on the following dimensions: purpose, theoretical grounding, stakeholder involvement, ethics and privacy, design, implementation, and evaluation criteria. The findings show that most dashboards are designed to increase teachers’ awareness but with limited actionable insights to allow intervention. Moreover, while teachers are involved in the design process, this is mainly at the exploratory/problem definition stage, with little input beyond this stage. Most dashboards were prescriptive, less customisable, and implicit about the theoretical constructs behind their designs. In addition, dashboards are deployed at prototype and pilot stages, and the evaluation is dominated by self-reports and users’ reactions with limited focus on changes to teaching and learning. Besides, only one study considered privacy as a design requirement.

Although several related works have scrutinised the state-of-the-art in the field of learning dashboards, none have addressed the theoretical foundation that should inform the design of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners.

Addressing this gap, the authors built upon the work of Tretow-Fish and Khalid (2022) and analyzed 32 papers, which were grouped into six categories (C1-6) based on their themes. The categories include C1) the evaluation of LA and LAD design and framework, C2) the evaluation of user performance with LA and LAD, C3) the evaluation of adaptivity, C4) the evaluation of ALPs through perceived value, C5) the evaluation of Multimodal methods, and C6) the evaluation of the pedagogical implementation of ALP’s LA and LAD. The results include a tabular summary of the papers including the categories, evaluation unit(s), methods, variables and purpose. While there are numerous studies in categories C1-4 that focus on the design, development, and impact assessment of ALP's LA and LAD, there are only a few studies in categories C5 and C6. For the category of C5), very few studies applied any evaluation methods assessing the multimodal features of LA and LADs on ALPs. Especially for C6), evaluating the pedagogical implementation of ALP's LA and LAD, the three dimensions of signature pedagogy are used to assess the level of pedagogy evaluation. Findings showed that no studies focus on evaluating the deep or implicit structure of ALP's LA. All studies examine the structural surface dimension of learning activities and interactions between students, teachers, and ALP's LA and LAD, as examined in categories C2-C5. No studies were exclusively categorized as a C6 category, indicating that all studies evaluate ALP's LA and LAD on the surface structure dimension of signature pedagogy.

These dashboards are informed by theory-oriented frameworks, designed to incorporate affordances that supporting student learning, and realised through integration of more than just activity data from learning management systems – allowing the dashboards to better support students' learnings processes.

However, developing SRL strategies is difficult for learners given the autonomy that is required in this kind of courses. In order to support learners on this process, researchers have proposed a variety of tools designed to support certain aspects of self-regulation in online learning environments. Nevertheless, there is a lack of study to understand what the commonalities and differences in terms of design are, what the results in terms of the effect on learners’ self-regulation are and which of them could be applied in MOOCs. Those are the questions that should be further explored. In this paper we present a systematic literature review where 22 tools designed to support SRL in online environments were analyzed. Our findings indicate that: (1) most of the studies do not evaluate the effect on learners’ SRL strategies; (2) the use of interactive visualizations has a positive effect on learners’ motivation; (3) the use of the social comparison component has a positive effect on engagement and time management; and (4) there is a lack of models to match learners’ activity with the tools with SRL strategies.

To date, this call for increased and more nuanced data has been translated into institutional use of data dashboards or learning analytics dashboards. While these dashboards have been extensively developed and adopted in higher education, there is limited research investigating the use of dashboards in K-12 education. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review examining dashboards as a decision-making system in K-12 settings. Our analysis indicates significant underuse of data in these dashboards, with a concerning scarcity of implementations and evaluations in real-world classroom environments. To counteract these shortcomings, we propose a set of recommendations designed to enhance dashboard development by promoting the use of Learner Profiles (LPs). These guidelines aim to support educational outcomes and student success by informing the design and deployment of fine-grained dashboards aligned with the specific needs of K-12 education. By highlighting the current gaps and offering forward-looking recommendations, our study clarifies the present landscape and serves as a foundation for future research, with significant implications for educators, policymakers, and scholars interested in using LPs to improve student learning outcomes.<br/></div> © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72315-5_4,,,Adversarial machine learning;Decision making;Federated learning;Students;Teaching;,,03029743,English,Dashboard;Decision-making systems;Decisions makings;Education sectors;K-12;K-12 education;Learner profiles;Systematic literature review;Systematic Review;Teaching and learning;,,"45588,9516203704","45588,9516203704",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating learning constructs.

This paper presents a systematic review following the PRISMA statement, about the adaptation capabilities of LADs based on new definitions for LADs and learning indicators. A detailed analysis of 23 articles selected among 426 articles retrieved from databases was conducted based on a coding scheme, centered on adaptation and its dimensions, namely: to whom, what, to what, who, and how. The main result of this study is that there is more evidence of adaptable LADs than adaptive LADs. As a result, the road to adaptivity is worth exploring. The analysis of LAD’s common features led us to distinguish mainly 4 adaptable capabilities and 2 adaptive ones. Most of the adaptable capabilities consist of giving exploration power to the user and providing him with data filtering, zooming, or selection functionalities. In contrast, users have limited options when it comes to selecting indicators, their visualizations, and organization on the dashboard. Providing more flexible LADs could enhance their usability and increase learner awareness. Furthermore, the few adaptive features involve adaptations based on ""if-then"" rules and there are no reports of advanced computing techniques such as machine learning that could empower LAD’s adaptation.<br/></div> Copyright © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.5220/0012628600003693,,,,,21845026,English,Adaptation;Adaptive features;Adaptivity;Coding scheme;Common features;Data filtering;Learning analytic dashboard;Learning indicator;Power;Systematic Review;,,"45588,9516203704","45588,9516203704",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

Student-facing LADs have been designed with various reference frames which enable various feedback, comparisons and reflection. However, there has been limited examination of the reference frames and their indicators employed in student-facing LADs as well as its evaluation. This research aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review using PRISMA to synthesize existing literature to identify and offer insights on reference frames and key indicators used in student-facing LADs. We identified 42 articles and analyzed that social reference frames as compared to progress reference frames are commonly employed in LADs. Key indicators include class performance average, class performance mean, average performance of the class, etc. These insights contribute to the ongoing development and best practices of LAD design. The knowledge and findings can help educators, researchers, system designers and policymakers decide how best to incorporate these tools into educational settings.<br/></div> © 2024 IEEE.",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CSTE62025.2024.00015,,,Petroleum reservoir evaluation;Students;,,,English,Continuous development;Development Learning;Key indicator;Learning analytic dashboard;Performance;PRISMA;Reference frame;Systematic literature review;Systematic Review;Technology in educations;,,"45588,9516203704","45588,9516203704",thiagogomesverissimo,,Duplicated,

higher education to the largest extent, and the successful completion of
individual learning tasks to the smallest extent. Factors affecting
study success range from individual dispositions (e.g., motivation,
prior academic performance) to characteristics of the educational
environment (e.g., attendance, active learning, social embeddedness).
Recent developments in learning analytics, which are a socio-technical
data mining and analytic practice in educational contexts, show promise
in enhancing study success in higher education, through the collection
and analysis of data from learners, learning processes, and learning
environments in order to provide meaningful feedback and scaffolds when
needed. This research reports a systematic review focusing on empirical
evidence, demonstrating how learning analytics have been successful in
facilitating study success in continuation and completion of students'
university courses. Using standardised steps of conducting a systematic
review, an initial set of 6220 articles was identified. The final sample
includes 46 key publications. The findings obtained in this systematic
review suggest that there are a considerable number of learning
analytics approaches which utilise effective techniques in supporting
study success and students at risk of dropping out. However, rigorous,
large-scale evidence of the effectiveness of learning analytics in

Addressing this gap, the authors built upon the work of Tretow-Fish and Khalid (2022) and analyzed 32 papers, which were grouped into six categories (C1-6) based on their themes. The categories include C1) the evaluation of LA and LAD design and framework, C2) the evaluation of user performance with LA and LAD, C3) the evaluation of adaptivity, C4) the evaluation of ALPs through perceived value, C5) the evaluation of Multimodal methods, and C6) the evaluation of the pedagogical implementation of ALP’s LA and LAD. The results include a tabular summary of the papers including the categories, evaluation unit(s), methods, variables and purpose. While there are numerous studies in categories C1-4 that focus on the design, development, and impact assessment of ALP's LA and LAD, there are only a few studies in categories C5 and C6. For the category of C5), very few studies applied any evaluation methods assessing the multimodal features of LA and LADs on ALPs. Especially for C6), evaluating the pedagogical implementation of ALP's LA and LAD, the three dimensions of signature pedagogy are used to assess the level of pedagogy evaluation. Findings showed that no studies focus on evaluating the deep or implicit structure of ALP's LA. All studies examine the structural surface dimension of learning activities and interactions between students, teachers, and ALP's LA and LAD, as examined in categories C2-C5. No studies were exclusively categorized as a C6 category, indicating that all studies evaluate ALP's LA and LAD on the surface structure dimension of signature pedagogy. This review highlights the lack of pedagogical methodology and theory in ALP's LA and LAD, which are recommended to be emphasized in future research and ALP development and implementation. © The Authors.",Article,10.34190/ejel.21.5.3088,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85180458888&doi=10.34190%2fejel.21.5.3088&partnerID=40&md5=5e219839d7380ae5a69ec9e26ba7d59a,,Adaptive Learning Platform; Learning Analytics; Methods of evaluation; Systematic literature review,,Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited,14794403,English,"Cited by: 4; All Open Access, Gold Open Access",,"45588,9519212963","45591,5477314815",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Accepted,

Despite the fact that learning analytics is a promising field of study, the lack of empirical evidence on the effects of learning analytics-based interventions has been widely addressed in recent years. In this context, insights validated by experimental studies may play a crucial role. Therefore, there is a need for a report describing the methodological aspects and effects of current experimental interventions based on learning analytics. This systematic review provides an in-depth examination of learning analytics research that reports experimental findings to evaluate learning analytics-based interventions. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 protocol provided the basis for the work of this systematic review. This review contained 52 papers that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that student-facing dashboards are the most common learning analytics-based intervention. Evidence from how user data is handled for interventions demonstrates that the most common method is the distillation of data for human judgment. This study confirms that a significant proportion of experimental studies employing learning analytics interventions have demonstrated significant effects on learning outcomes. The effectiveness of learning analytics-based interventions is also addressed in this review in terms of motivation, engagement, and system usage behaviors. The findings of this study will contribute to the literature in terms of describing the experimentally validated findings of learning analytics-based interventions in depth. © 2022 Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022.

To date, this call for increased and more nuanced data has been translated into institutional use of data dashboards or learning analytics dashboards. While these dashboards have been extensively developed and adopted in higher education, there is limited research investigating the use of dashboards in K-12 education. To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review examining dashboards as a decision-making system in K-12 settings. Our analysis indicates significant underuse of data in these dashboards, with a concerning scarcity of implementations and evaluations in real-world classroom environments. To counteract these shortcomings, we propose a set of recommendations designed to enhance dashboard development by promoting the use of Learner Profiles (LPs). These guidelines aim to support educational outcomes and student success by informing the design and deployment of fine-grained dashboards aligned with the specific needs of K-12 education. By highlighting the current gaps and offering forward-looking recommendations, our study clarifies the present landscape and serves as a foundation for future research, with significant implications for educators, policymakers, and scholars interested in using LPs to improve student learning outcomes. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Conference paper,10.1007/978-3-031-72315-5_4,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205123908&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-72315-5_4&partnerID=40&md5=dda1262269879cd573d67eff08b30bce,,Dashboards; Decision-making; K-12; Learner Profiles; Systematic literature review,Adversarial machine learning; Decision making; Federated learning; Students; Teaching; Dashboard; Decision-making systems; Decisions makings; Education sectors; K-12; K-12 education; Learner profiles; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Teaching and learning; Contrastive Learning,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,03029743,English,"Cited by: 0; Conference name: 19th European Conference on Technology Enhanced Learning, EC-TEL 2024; Conference date: 16 September 2024 through 20 September 2024; Conference code: 319189","É uma revisão sistemática em LAD, mas não com foco no ensino superior","45588,9519212963","45615,0630324074",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

This paper presents a systematic review following the PRISMA statement, about the adaptation capabilities of LADs based on new definitions for LADs and learning indicators. A detailed analysis of 23 articles selected among 426 articles retrieved from databases was conducted based on a coding scheme, centered on adaptation and its dimensions, namely: to whom, what, to what, who, and how. The main result of this study is that there is more evidence of adaptable LADs than adaptive LADs. As a result, the road to adaptivity is worth exploring. The analysis of LAD’s common features led us to distinguish mainly 4 adaptable capabilities and 2 adaptive ones. Most of the adaptable capabilities consist of giving exploration power to the user and providing him with data filtering, zooming, or selection functionalities. In contrast, users have limited options when it comes to selecting indicators, their visualizations, and organization on the dashboard. Providing more flexible LADs could enhance their usability and increase learner awareness. Furthermore, the few adaptive features involve adaptations based on “if-then” rules and there are no reports of advanced computing techniques such as machine learning that could empower LAD’s adaptation.

New tools such as educational games offer promising advantages: they can personalize feedback to students and save educators time by automating the assessment process. However, while many teachers agree that educational games increase motivation, learning, and retention, few are ready to fully trust them as an assessment tool. A likely reason behind this lack of trust is that educational games are distributed as black boxes, unmodifiable by educators and not providing enough insight about the gameplay. This chapter presents three systematic literature reviews looking into the integration of assessment, feedback, and learning analytics in educational games. It then proposes a framework and present a fully developed engine. The engine is used by both developers and educators. Designed to separate game and assessment, it allows teachers to modify the assessment after distribution and visualize gameplay data via a learning analytics dashboard. © 2022, IGI Global.",Book chapter,10.4018/978-1-6684-3710-0.ch088,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163656150&doi=10.4018%2f978-1-6684-3710-0.ch088&partnerID=40&md5=8cc5632e76753fcde156628adf17d03e,,,,IGI Global,,English,Cited by: 0,É uma revisão sistemática não relacionada a Learning Analytics ou LAD,"45588,9519212963","45591,5704861111",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

,"Development of Visual Learning Analytic Tools to Explore Performance and Engagement of Students in Primary, Secondary, and Higher Education","Mohseni, Zeynab",,2024,OpenAlex,,,"Schools and educational institutions collect large amounts of data about students and their learning, including text, grades, quizzes, timestamps, and other activities. However, in primary and secondary education, this data is often dispersed across different digital platforms, lacking standardized methods for collection, processing, analysis, and presentation. These issues hinder teachers and students from making informed decisions or strategic and effective use of data. This presents a significant obstacle to progress in education and the effective development of Educational Technology (EdTech) products. Visual Learning Analytics (VLA) tools, also known as Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs), are designed to visualize student data to support pedagogical decision-making. Despite their potential, the effectiveness of these tools remains limited. Addressing these challenges requires both technical solutions and thoughtful design considerations, as explored in Papers 1 through 5 of this thesis. Paper 1 examines the design aspects of VLA tools by evaluating higher education data and various visualization and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Paper 2 provides broader insights into the VLA landscape through a systematic review, mapping key concepts and research gaps in VLA and emphasizing the potential of VLA tools to enhance pedagogical decisions and learning outcomes. Meanwhile, Paper 3 delves into a technical solution (data pipeline and data standard) considering a secure Swedish warehouse, SUNET. This includes a data standard for integrating educational data into SUNET, along with customized scripts to reformat, merge, and hash multiple student datasets. Papers 4 and 5 focus on design aspects, with Paper 4 discussing the proposed Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach involving teachers in co-designing a simple VLA tool. Paper 5 introduces a scenario-based framework for Multiple Learning Analytics Dashboards (MLADs) development, stressing user engagement for tailored LADs that facilitate informed decision-making in education. The dissertation offers a comprehensive approach to advancing VLA tools, integrating technical solutions with user-centric design principles. By addressing data integration challenges and involving users in tool development, these efforts aim to empower teachers in leveraging educational data for improved teaching and learning experiences.",Thesis,10.15626/lud.532.2024,https://doi.org/10.15626/lud.532.2024,,,Student Performance Prediction | Student Engagement | Data-driven Education | Learning Analytics | Educational Data Mining | Primary (astronomy),,,,,É um estudo primário sobre LAD e não uma revisão sistemática ,"45588,9518055556","45591,5764236111",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

of educational data has boosted the interest in Learning Analytics
Dashboard (LAD) applications as a way to provide meaningful visual
information to administrators, parents, teachers and learners. Despite
the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and
their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is
known about LADs' theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack
thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to
evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to
illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and
implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning
perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature
review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing
LAD's target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate
their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15
databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative
analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between
LADs' intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation
(mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise
that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation
from this study is that LADs' target outcomes should guide the selection
of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment
is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to
inform future endeavours in the field.
Practitioner notes
What is already known about this topic
There has been an increased interest and investment in learning
analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users.
Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different
purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence
learners' behaviour, achievement and skills.
What this paper adds
This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of
learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of
implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning
analytics dashboard studies.
The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely
overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics
dashboards.
Implications for practice and/or policy
Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes
recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important
target outcome).
The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation

Objective The paper reviews the current research on intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call model‐based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision making. Methods Using a systematic literature review methodology, we first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for teachers and learners. Results and Conclusions A majority of papers used either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with theory‐driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that model‐based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact on learning and decision making by teachers and students.

We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60\% are based on a single type of data; 33\% use behavioral metrics; 39\% support input from the user; 37\% have complex models; and just 6\% involve multiple applications. Key associated themes include intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and self-regulated learning. Notably, compared with LADs, OLM research is more likely to be interactive (81\% of papers compared with 31\% for LADs), report evaluations (76\% versus 59\%), use assessment data (100\% versus 37\%), provide a comparison standard for students (52\% versus 38\%), but less likely to use behavioral metrics, or resource use data (33\% against 75\% for LADs).

A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners.",Journal Article,10.1145/3170358.3170421,https://doi.org/10.1145/3170358.3170421,,,Learning Analytics | Data-driven Education | Dashboard | Cultural analytics | Educational Data Mining | Blended Learning | Educational Technology | Bridge (graph theory) | Learning sciences,,,,,,"45588,9518055556","45597,8058564815",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Duplicated,

Several factors must be accounted; from the data to be displayed to the audience that will use the dashboard. However, the increase in popularity of these tools has extended their use in several and very different contexts among very different user profiles. This popularization has increased the necessity of building tailored displays focused on specific requirements, goals, user roles, situations, domains, etc. Requirements are more sophisticated and varying; thus, dashboards need to match them to enhance knowledge generation and support more complex decision-making processes. This sophistication has led to the proposal of new approaches to address personal requirements and foster individualization regarding dashboards without involving high quantities of resources and long development processes. The goal of this work is to present a systematic review of the literature to analyze and classify the existing dashboard solutions that support tailoring capabilities and the methodologies used to achieve them. The methodology follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the field of software engineering. As results, 23 papers about tailored dashboards were retrieved. Three main approaches were identified regarding tailored solutions: customization, personalization, and adaptation. However, there is a wide variety of employed paradigms and features to develop tailored dashboards. The present systematic literature review analyzes challenges and issues regarding the existing solutions.

This paper presents a systematic review that follows the PRISMA statement and analyzes the adaptation features of LADs and their potential effects on learning. 24 of the 462 articles retrieved were scrutinized using an analysis framework centered on adaptation. The main finding is that there is more evidence of adaptable LADs than adaptive LADs, suggesting that adaptivity is worth exploring. The results mainly highlight 3 common LADs adaptable capabilities - most of which offer data exploration features - and 2 adaptive ones that change or refresh indicators on dashboards. Only a few articles investigate the adaptation of indicator visualizations or organization on dashboards. Currently, there is no work on the use of advanced computing techniques such as machine learning for LADs adaptation. Additionally, only 5 articles provide some evidence of dashboards adaptation features evaluation. As a result, a preliminary research agenda on LADs adaptation is suggested for enhancing LADs adoption and utility.<br/></div> © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-72315-5_3,,,Contrastive Learning;Federated learning;,,03029743,English,Adaptation;Adaptive learning;Adaptivity;Analysis frameworks;Computing techniques;Data exploration;Learning analytic dashboard;Learning indicator;Potential effects;Systematic Review;,Estudo duplicado (descartado pois foi escolhido o texto mais recente e completo),"45588,9516203704","45615,0702662037",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

Researchers are increasingly interested in using physiological data, such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), as an objective tool to measure bodily reactions during collaborative activities. However, it remains unclear how physiological data can contribute to our understanding, monitoring and support of the collaborative learning process. To address this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing on the contribution of physiological data to collaborative learning, the features of physiological data that correlate with effective outcomes, and interventions designed to support collaboration based on physiological data. The review identified 13 relevant publications that revealed physiological data can indeed be useful for detecting certain aspects of collaboration including students’ cognitive, behavioral, and affective (emotion and motivation) states. Physiological arousal in the form of EDA peaks and physiological synchrony (interdependence or associated activity between individuals’ physiological signals) were the most commonly used features. Surprisingly, only one publication presented a prototype of a learning analytics dashboard that used physiological data to guide student reflections. Furthermore, the review highlights the potential for integrating physiological measures with other data sources, such as speech, eye gaze, and facial expression, to uncover psychophysiological reactions and accompanying social and contextual processes related to collaborative learning. Future research should consider embedding methods for the physiological detection and modeling of learning constructs within explicit, feedback-driven interventions for collaborative learning.<br/></div> © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-42682-7_6,,,Psychophysiology;,,03029743,English,Collaborative activities;Collaborative learning;Collaborative learning process;Data-source;Electrodermal activity;Eye-gaze;Physiological data;Physiological measures;Physiological signals;Systematic literature review;,"É uma revisão sistemática em Learning Analytics, mas não focada apenas em LAD","45588,9516203704","45597,744537037",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

While much attention has been paid to developing teacher-facing dashboards, less is known about how they are designed, implemented and evaluated. This paper presents a systematic literature review of existing studies reporting on teacher-facing LA dashboards. Out of the 1968 articles retrieved from several databases, 50 articles were included in the final analysis. Guided by several frameworks, articles were coded based on the following dimensions: purpose, theoretical grounding, stakeholder involvement, ethics and privacy, design, implementation, and evaluation criteria. The findings show that most dashboards are designed to increase teachers' awareness but with limited actionable insights to allow intervention. Moreover, while teachers are involved in the design process, this is mainly at the exploratory/problem definition stage, with little input beyond this stage. Most dashboards were prescriptive, less customisable, and implicit about the theoretical constructs behind their designs. In addition, dashboards are deployed at prototype and pilot stages, and the evaluation is dominated by self-reports and users' reactions with limited focus on changes to teaching and learning. Besides, only one study considered privacy as a design requirement.

,"Have Learning Analytics Dashboards Lived Up to the Hype? A Systematic Review of Impact on Students' Achievement, Motivation, Participation and Attitude","Kaliisa, Rogers and Misiejuk, Kamila and López-Pernas, Sonsoles and Khalil, Mohammad and Saqr, Mohammed",,2023,ProQuest,,,"While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on students learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments.

Despite the fact that learning analytics is a promising field of study, the lack of empirical evidence on the effects of learning analytics-based interventions has been widely addressed in recent years. In this context, insights validated by experimental studies may play a crucial role. Therefore, there is a need for a report describing the methodological aspects and effects of current experimental interventions based on learning analytics. This systematic review provides an in-depth examination of learning analytics research that reports experimental findings to evaluate learning analytics-based interventions. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 protocol provided the basis for the work of this systematic review. This review contained 52 papers that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results show that student-facing dashboards are the most common learning analytics-based intervention. Evidence from how user data is handled for interventions demonstrates that the most common method is the distillation of data for human judgment. This study confirms that a significant proportion of experimental studies employing learning analytics interventions have demonstrated significant effects on learning outcomes. The effectiveness of learning analytics-based interventions is also addressed in this review in terms of motivation, engagement, and system usage behaviors.

Addressing this gap, the authors built upon the work of Tretow-Fish and Khalid (2022) and analyzed 32 papers, which were grouped into six categories (C1-6) based on their themes. The categories include C1) the evaluation of LA and LAD design and framework, C2) the evaluation of user performance with LA and LAD, C3) the evaluation of adaptivity, C4) the evaluation of ALPs through perceived value, C5) the evaluation of Multimodal methods, and C6) the evaluation of the pedagogical implementation of ALP's LA and LAD. The results include a tabular summary of the papers including the categories, evaluation unit(s), methods, variables and purpose. While there are numerous studies in categories C1-4 that focus on the design, development, and impact assessment of ALP's LA and LAD, there are only a few studies in categories C5 and C6. For the category of C5), very few studies applied any evaluation methods assessing the multimodal features of LA and LADs on ALPs.

This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments.

,Advancing equity and inclusion in educational practices with AI-powered educational decision support systems (AI-EDSS),"Viberg, Olga and Kizilcec, René F. and Wise, Alyssa Friend and Jivet, Ioana and Nixon, Nia",British Journal of Educational Technology,2024,wiley,1974-1981,55,"Abstract A key goal of educational institutions around the world is to provide inclusive, equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all learners. Achieving this requires contextualized approaches to accommodate diverse global values and promote learning opportunities that best meet the needs and goals of all learners as individuals and members of different communities. Advances in learning analytics (LA), natural language processes (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI technologies, offer potential to aid educational decision making by supporting analytic insights and personalized recommendations. However, these technologies also raise serious risks for reinforcing or exacerbating existing inequalities; these dangers arise from multiple factors including biases represented in training datasets, the technologies' abilities to take autonomous decisions, and processes for tool development that do not centre the needs and concerns of historically marginalized groups. To ensure that Educational Decision Support Systems (EDSS), particularly AI-powered ones, are equipped to promote equity, they must be created and evaluated holistically, considering their potential for both targeted and systemic impacts on all learners, especially members of historically marginalized groups. Adopting a socio-technical and cultural perspective is crucial for designing, deploying, and evaluating AI-EDSS that truly advance educational equity and inclusion. This editorial introduces the contributions of five papers for the special section on advancing equity and inclusion in educational practices with AI-EDSS. These papers focus on (i) a review of biases in large language models (LLMs) applications offers practical guidelines for their evaluation to promote educational equity, (ii) techniques to mitigate disparities across countries and languages in LLMs representation of educationally relevant knowledge, (iii) implementing equitable and intersectionality-aware machine learning applications in education, (iv) introducing a LA dashboard that aims to promote institutional equality, diversity, and inclusion, and (v) vulnerable student digital well-being in AI-EDSS. Together, these contributions underscore the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in developing and utilizing AI-EDSS to not only foster a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape worldwide but also reveal a critical need for a broader contextualization of equity that incorporates the socio-technical questions of what kinds of decisions AI is being used to support, for what purposes, and whose goals are prioritized in this process.",,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13507,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjet.13507,,,"AI, AI-EDSS, bias, education, equality, inclusion",,,,,Não é um artigo,"45598,5941087963","45598,6358912037",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

,Is it time we get real? A systematic review of the potential of data-driven technologies to address teachers' implicit biases,"Gauthier, Andrea and Rizvi, Saman and Cukurova, Mutlu and Mavrikis, Manolis",Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence,2022,Scopus,,5,"Data-driven technologies for education, such as artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) systems, learning analytics dashboards, open learner models, and other applications, are often created with an aspiration to help teachers make better, evidence-informed decisions in the classroom. Addressing gender, racial, and other biases inherent to data and algorithms in such applications is seen as a way to increase the responsibility of these systems and has been the focus of much of the research in the field, including systematic reviews. However, implicit biases can also be held by teachers. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic literature review is the first of its kind to investigate what kinds of teacher biases have been impacted by data-driven technologies, how or if these technologies were designed to challenge these biases, and which strategies were most effective at promoting equitable teaching behaviors and decision making. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search of five databases returned n = 359 records of which only n = 2 studies by a single research team were identified as relevant. The findings show that there is minimal evidence that data-driven technologies have been evaluated in their capacity for supporting teachers to make less biased decisions or promote equitable teaching behaviors, even though this capacity is often used as one of the core arguments for the use of data-driven technologies in education. By examining these two studies in conjunction with related studies that did not meet the eligibility criteria during the full-text review, we reveal the approaches that could play an effective role in mitigating teachers' biases, as well as ones that may perpetuate biases. We conclude by summarizing directions for future research that should seek to directly confront teachers' biases through explicit design strategies within teacher tools, to ensure that the impact of biases of both technology (including data, algorithms, models etc.) and teachers are minimized. We propose an extended framework to support future research and design in this area, through motivational, cognitive, and technological debiasing strategies.

We conducted a systematic review of literature on OLMs and compared the results with a previously conducted review of LADs for learners in terms of (i) data use and modelling, (ii) key publication venues, (iii) authors and articles, (iv) key themes, and (v) system evaluation. We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60% are based on a single type of data; 33% use behavioral metrics; 39% support input from the user; 37% have complex models; and just 6% involve multiple applications. Key associated themes include intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and self-regulated learning. Notably, compared with LADs, OLM research is more likely to be interactive (81% of papers compared with 31% for LADs), report evaluations (76% versus 59%), use assessment data (100% versus 37%), provide a comparison standard for students (52% versus 38%), but less likely to use behavioral metrics, or resource use data (33% against 75% for LADs). In OLM work, there was a heightened focus on learner control and access to their own data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference paper,10.1145/3170358.3170409,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045874117&doi=10.1145%2f3170358.3170409&partnerID=40&md5=e6a71082257743b6aa99cedba60c86a5,,Learning analytics dashboards; Literature review; Open learner models; Open student models,Access control; Computer aided instruction; Students; Comparison standard; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning analytics; Literature reviews; Multiple applications; Open learner models; Open student models; Self-regulated learning; Learning systems,Association for Computing Machinery,,English,"Cited by: 115; Conference name: 8th International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge, LAK 2018; Conference date: 5 March 2018 through 9 March 2018; Conference code: 135442; All Open Access, Green Open Access","É uma revisão sistemática em Learning Analytics, mas não focada apenas em LAD","45588,9519212963","45597,8003356482",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,

classroom, there is now a need to better understand the complementarity
of intelligent learning technology and teachers to produce effective
instruction. ObjectiveThe paper reviews the current research on
intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student
learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call
model-based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the
coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent
system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision
making. MethodsUsing a systematic literature review methodology, we
first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent
tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our
selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which
the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for
teachers and learners. Results and ConclusionsA majority of papers used
either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions
are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of
papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with
theory-driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that
model-based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of
the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics
tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as
in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with
evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction
between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact
on learning and decision making by teachers and students. We offer a
taxonomy of knowledge models that can serve as a starting point for
designing such interaction.",Review,10.1111/jcal.12844,,"Ley, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Continuing Educ Krems, Krems An Der Donau, Austria.Ley, Tobias; Pishtari, Gerti, Univ Continuing Educ Krems, Ctr Digitalizat Lifelong Learning, Krems An Der Donau, Austria.Ley, Tobias; Tammets, Kairit; Chejara, Pankaj; Kasepalu, Reet; Saar, Merike; Vaeljataga, Terje, Tallinn Univ, Ctr Educ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.Khalil, Mohammad; Wasson, Barbara, Univ Bergen, Ctr Sci Learning \& Technol SLATE, Bergen, Norway.Tuvi, Iiris, Univ Tartu, Inst Psychol, Tartu,",,adaptive learning technology; hybrid human-AI technologies; intelligenttutoring systems; learning analytics; systematic literature review;teacher dashboards,WILEY,0266-4909,English,,"É uma revisão sistemática em Learning Analytics, mas não focada apenas em LAD","45588,952037037","45591,5435416667",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Rejected,
,"Have Learning Analytics Dashboards Lived Up to the Hype? A SystematicReview of Impact on Students′ Achievement, Motivation, Participation andAttitude","Kaliisa, Rogers and Misiejuk, Kamila and Lopez-Pernas, Sonsoles andKhalil, Mohammad and Saqr, Mohammed",,2024,Web of Science,295-304,,"While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of
LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on
students' learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the
findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on
students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation,
motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence
to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of
improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or
small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled
experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs,
confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels.
Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared
modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects.
Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale
investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a
relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies
reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote
engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However,
methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation
methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to
usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring
issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use
rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating
learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the
potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable
insights for educators and researchers alike.",Proceedings Paper,10.1145/3636555.3636884,,"Kaliisa, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway.Kaliisa, Rogers, Univ Oslo, Dept Educ, Oslo, Norway.Misiejuk, Kamila; Khalil, Mohammad, Univ Bergen, Ctr Sci Learning \& Technol SLATE, Bergen, Norway.Lopez-Pernas, Sonsoles; Saqr, Mohammed, Univ Eastern Finland, Sch Comp, Joensuu, Finland.",,Learning analytics dashboards (LADs); systematic review; impact;learning outcomes,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,English,"14th Annual International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge(LAK) - Learning Analytics in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, Kyoto,JAPAN, MAR 18-22, 2024",,"45588,952037037","45598,6450578704",thiagogomesverissimo,thiagogomesverissimo,Duplicated,

Our overview of the latest systematic reviews on the topic shows a number of research trends: learning analytics research is growing rapidly; it brings to the front inequality and inclusiveness measures; it reveals an unclear path to data ownership and privacy; it provides predictions which are not clearly translated into pedagogical actions; and the possibility of self-regulated learning and game-based learning are not capitalized upon.

Such tools could aid teachers in primary and secondary schools in making pedagogical decisions, however, the evidence of their effectiveness and benefits is still limited. With this scoping review, we provide a comprehensive overview of related research on proposed VLA methods, as well as identifying any gaps in the literature that could assist in describing new and helpful directions to the field. This review searched all relevant articles in five accessible databases — Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, ACM, and IEEE Xplore — using 40 keywords. These studies were mapped, categorized, and summarized based on their objectives, the collected data, the intervention approaches employed, and the results obtained. The results determined what affordances the VLA tools allowed, what kind of visualizations were used to inform teachers and students, and, more importantly, positive evidence of educational interventions. We conclude that there are moderate-to-clear learning improvements within the limit of the studies’ interventions to support the use of VLA tools. More systematic research is needed to determine whether any learning gains are translated into long-term improvements. © 2024, Society for Learning Analytics Research (SOLAR).

A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners.

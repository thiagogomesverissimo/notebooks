abstract = {Abstract The paper argues that learning analytics as a research field can benefit from a theory-informed shared language to describe sensemaking of learning and teaching data. To make the case for such shared language, first, I critically review prominent sensemaking theories to then demonstrate how studies in learning analytics do not use coherent descriptions of sensemaking, eclectically combining the paradigms that have underlying differences. I then propose a conceptualization of sensemaking that overcomes the differences between these theories and explains how the concepts of activity system, the definition of the situation and affordances can be used to capture individual differences in sensemaking. The paper concludes with a preliminary framework and examples demonstrating its utility in raising new theoretical questions, informing design principles and providing shared language for researchers in learning analytics.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Sensemaking happens when individuals try to explain unknown situations. Learning analytics uses sensemaking as a lens to understand dashboard use. Systematic analysis of sensemaking is essential for learning analytics. What this paper adds The paper notes that noticing and perceiving are commonly examined in learning analytics on dashboard use. The paper suggests a revision of fundamental assumptions in sensemaking. A paper proposes a toy model of sensemaking that includes operationalization of the definition of the situation, activity where sensemaking happens and processes of noticing and perceiving affordances. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics must examine sensemaking of data about teaching and learning in a systematic manner. Internal perceptions of the social environment and activity that are informed by the data need to be considered in evaluating dashboard use.},

abstract = {Abstract The advances in technology to capture and process unprecedented amounts of educational data has boosted the interest in Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) applications as a way to provide meaningful visual information to administrators, parents, teachers and learners. Despite the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is known about LADs’ theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing LAD’s target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15 databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between LADs’ intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation from this study is that LADs’ target outcomes should guide the selection of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to inform future endeavours in the field. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There has been an increased interest and investment in learning analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users. Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence learners’ behaviour, achievement and skills. What this paper adds This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning analytics dashboard studies. The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics dashboards. Implications for practice and/or policy Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important target outcome). The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards. The paper also highlights the need for further integration between learner-facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models.},

abstract = {Abstract A key goal of educational institutions around the world is to provide inclusive, equitable quality education and lifelong learning opportunities for all learners. Achieving this requires contextualized approaches to accommodate diverse global values and promote learning opportunities that best meet the needs and goals of all learners as individuals and members of different communities. Advances in learning analytics (LA), natural language processes (NLP), and artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI technologies, offer potential to aid educational decision making by supporting analytic insights and personalized recommendations. However, these technologies also raise serious risks for reinforcing or exacerbating existing inequalities; these dangers arise from multiple factors including biases represented in training datasets, the technologies' abilities to take autonomous decisions, and processes for tool development that do not centre the needs and concerns of historically marginalized groups. To ensure that Educational Decision Support Systems (EDSS), particularly AI-powered ones, are equipped to promote equity, they must be created and evaluated holistically, considering their potential for both targeted and systemic impacts on all learners, especially members of historically marginalized groups. Adopting a socio-technical and cultural perspective is crucial for designing, deploying, and evaluating AI-EDSS that truly advance educational equity and inclusion. This editorial introduces the contributions of five papers for the special section on advancing equity and inclusion in educational practices with AI-EDSS. These papers focus on (i) a review of biases in large language models (LLMs) applications offers practical guidelines for their evaluation to promote educational equity, (ii) techniques to mitigate disparities across countries and languages in LLMs representation of educationally relevant knowledge, (iii) implementing equitable and intersectionality-aware machine learning applications in education, (iv) introducing a LA dashboard that aims to promote institutional equality, diversity, and inclusion, and (v) vulnerable student digital well-being in AI-EDSS. Together, these contributions underscore the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in developing and utilizing AI-EDSS to not only foster a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape worldwide but also reveal a critical need for a broader contextualization of equity that incorporates the socio-technical questions of what kinds of decisions AI is being used to support, for what purposes, and whose goals are prioritized in this process.},

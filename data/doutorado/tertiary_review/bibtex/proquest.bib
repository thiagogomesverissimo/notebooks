    abstract = "Interactive multimedia experiences (IME) can be a pedagogical resource that has a strong potential to enhance learning experiences in early childhood. Learning analytics (LA) has become an important tool that allows us to understand more clearly how these multimedia experiences can contribute to the learning processes of these students. This article proposes a work route that defines a set of activities and techniques, as well as a flow for their application, by taking into consideration the importance of including LA guidelines when designing IMEs for elementary education. The work route’s graphical representation is inspired by the foundations of the Essence standard’s graphical notation language. The guidelines are grouped into five categories, namely (i) a data analytics dashboard, (ii) student data, (iii) teacher data, (iv) learning activity data, and (v) student progress data. The guidelines were validated through two approaches. The first involved a case study, where the guidelines were applied to an IME called Coco Shapes, which was aimed at transition students at the Colegio La Fontaine in Cali (Colombia), and the second involved the judgments of experts who examined the usefulness and clarity of the guidelines. The results from these approaches allowed us to obtain precise and effective feedback regarding the hypothesis under study. Our findings provide promising evidence of the value of our guidelines, which were included in the design of an IME and contributed to the greater personalized monitoring available to teachers to evaluate student learning.",

    abstract = "While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on students learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation, motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs, confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels. Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects. Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However, methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable insights for educators and researchers alike.",

    abstract = "Higher education institutions are moving to design and implement teacher-facing learning analytics (LA) dashboards with the hope that instructors can extract deep insights about student learning and make informed decisions to improve their teaching. While much attention has been paid to developing teacher-facing dashboards, less is known about how they are designed, implemented and evaluated. This paper presents a systematic literature review of existing studies reporting on teacher-facing LA dashboards. Out of the 1968 articles retrieved from several databases, 50 articles were included in the final analysis. Guided by several frameworks, articles were coded based on the following dimensions: purpose, theoretical grounding, stakeholder involvement, ethics and privacy, design, implementation, and evaluation criteria. The findings show that most dashboards are designed to increase teachers’ awareness but with limited actionable insights to allow intervention. Moreover, while teachers are involved in the design process, this is mainly at the exploratory/problem definition stage, with little input beyond this stage. Most dashboards were prescriptive, less customisable, and implicit about the theoretical constructs behind their designs. In addition, dashboards are deployed at prototype and pilot stages, and the evaluation is dominated by self-reports and users’ reactions with limited focus on changes to teaching and learning. Besides, only one study considered privacy as a design requirement. Based on the findings of the study and synthesis of existing literature, we propose a four-dimensional checklist for planning, designing, implementing and evaluating LA dashboards.",

    abstract = "MOOCs offer great learning opportunities, but they also present several challenges for learners that hinder them from successfully completing MOOCs. To address these challenges, edX-LIMS (System for Learning Intervention and its Monitoring for edX MOOCs) was developed. It is a learning analytics system that supports an intervention strategy (based on learners’ interactions with the MOOC) to provide feedback to learners through web-based Learner Dashboards. Additionally, edX-LIMS provides a web-based Instructor Dashboard for instructors to monitor their learners. In this article, an enhanced version of the aforementioned system called edX-LIMS+ is presented. This upgrade introduces new services that enhance both the learners’ and instructors’ dashboards with a particular focus on self-regulated learning. Moreover, the system detects learners’ problems to guide them and assist instructors in better monitoring learners and providing necessary support. The results obtained from the use of this new version (through learners’ interactions and opinions about their dashboards) demonstrate that the feedback provided has been significantly improved, offering more valuable information to learners and enhancing their perception of both the dashboard and the intervention strategy supported by the system. Additionally, the majority of learners agreed with their detected problems, thereby enabling instructors to enhance interventions and support learners’ learning processes.",

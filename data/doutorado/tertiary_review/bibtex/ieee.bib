  abstract={As the integration of technology in education undergoes continuous development, Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) have become vital tools for both instructors and learners, facilitating the monitoring and optimization of the learning experience. Student-facing LADs have been designed with various reference frames which enable various feedback, comparisons and reflection. However, there has been limited examination of the reference frames and their indicators employed in student-facing LADs as well as its evaluation. This research aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review using PRISMA to synthesize existing literature to identify and offer insights on reference frames and key indicators used in student-facing LADs. We identified 42 articles and analyzed that social reference frames as compared to progress reference frames are commonly employed in LADs. Key indicators include class performance average, class performance mean, average performance of the class, etc. These insights contribute to the ongoing development and best practices of LAD design. The knowledge and findings can help educators, researchers, system designers and policymakers decide how best to incorporate these tools into educational settings.},

  abstract={This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of research on learning dashboards in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful to different stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased use of educational technologies, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The initial search of five main academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out of which 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as various aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity regarding evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards. There is a need for longitudinal research in authentic settings and studies that systematically compare different dashboard designs.},

  abstract={The design and development of information dashboards are not trivial. Several factors must be accounted; from the data to be displayed to the audience that will use the dashboard. However, the increase in popularity of these tools has extended their use in several and very different contexts among very different user profiles. This popularization has increased the necessity of building tailored displays focused on specific requirements, goals, user roles, situations, domains, etc. Requirements are more sophisticated and varying; thus, dashboards need to match them to enhance knowledge generation and support more complex decision-making processes. This sophistication has led to the proposal of new approaches to address personal requirements and foster individualization regarding dashboards without involving high quantities of resources and long development processes. The goal of this work is to present a systematic review of the literature to analyze and classify the existing dashboard solutions that support tailoring capabilities and the methodologies used to achieve them. The methodology follows the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and other authors in the field of software engineering. As results, 23 papers about tailored dashboards were retrieved. Three main approaches were identified regarding tailored solutions: customization, personalization, and adaptation. However, there is a wide variety of employed paradigms and features to develop tailored dashboards. The present systematic literature review analyzes challenges and issues regarding the existing solutions. It also identifies new research paths to enhance tailoring capabilities and thus, to improve user experience and insight delivery when it comes to visual analysis.},

  abstract={Technology-and analytics-enhanced self-assessments may provide multiple benefits for learners. However, data analytics approaches currently fail to make full use of educational technology and data for self-assessment. This research focuses on the implementation of an environment for self-assessment including a data-driven dashboard in the context of higher education and examines learners’ usage behaviors of N= 100 learners in three experimentally varied conditions. Findings indicate an intensive use of the self-assessments and data-driven dashboards throughout the semester. However, no differences in the interaction of learners with the different dashboard conditions were found. In conclusion, the design of data-driven dashboards for self-assessments requires valid information about learners, assessment processes, and the context of the assessment to better support the current needs of the learner and provide meaningful feedback to foster learning processes and outcomes.},

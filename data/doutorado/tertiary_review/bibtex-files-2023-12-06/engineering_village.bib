abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">The advances in technology to capture and process unprecedented amounts of educational data has boosted the interest in Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) applications as a way to provide meaningful visual information to administrators, parents, teachers and learners. Despite the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is known about LADs&rsquo; theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing LAD&rsquo;s target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15 databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between LADs&rsquo; intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation from this study is that LADs&rsquo; target outcomes should guide the selection of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to inform future endeavours in the field. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There has been an increased interest and investment in learning analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users. Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence learners&rsquo; behaviour, achievement and skills. What this paper adds This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning analytics dashboard studies. The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics dashboards. Implications for practice and/or policy Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important target outcome). The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards. The paper also highlights the need for further integration between learner-facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 British Educational Research Association.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Collaborative learning is an important approach in education. Researchers are increasingly interested in using physiological data, such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), as an objective tool to measure bodily reactions during collaborative activities. However, it remains unclear how physiological data can contribute to our understanding, monitoring and support of the collaborative learning process. To address this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing on the contribution of physiological data to collaborative learning, the features of physiological data that correlate with effective outcomes, and interventions designed to support collaboration based on physiological data. The review identified 13 relevant publications that revealed physiological data can indeed be useful for detecting certain aspects of collaboration including students&rsquo; cognitive, behavioral, and affective (emotion and motivation) states. Physiological arousal in the form of EDA peaks and physiological synchrony (interdependence or associated activity between individuals&rsquo; physiological signals) were the most commonly used features. Surprisingly, only one publication presented a prototype of a learning analytics dashboard that used physiological data to guide student reflections. Furthermore, the review highlights the potential for integrating physiological measures with other data sources, such as speech, eye gaze, and facial expression, to uncover psychophysiological reactions and accompanying social and contextual processes related to collaborative learning. Future research should consider embedding methods for the physiological detection and modeling of learning constructs within explicit, feedback-driven interventions for collaborative learning.<br/></div> &copy; 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful to different stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased use of educational technologies, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The initial search of five main academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out of which 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as various aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity regarding evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards.

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) provide educators and students with a comprehensive snapshot of the learning domain. Visualizations showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing learning difficulties. While LADs have gained popularity, existing LADs are still far behind when it comes to employing predictive analytics into their designs. Our systematic literature review has revealed limitations in the utilization of predictive analytics tools among existing LADs. We find that studies leveraging predictive analytics only go as far as identifying the at-risk students and do not employ model interpretation or explainability capabilities. This limits the ability of LADs to offer data-driven prescriptive advice to students that can offer them guidance on appropriate learning adjustments. Further, published studies have mostly described LADs that are still at prototype stages; hence, robust evaluations of how LADs affect student outcomes have not yet been conducted. The evaluations until now are limited to LAD functionalities and usability rather than their effectiveness as a pedagogical treatment. We conclude by making recommendations for the design of advanced dashboards that more fully take advantage of machine learning technologies, while using suitable visualizations to project only relevant information. Finally, we stress the importance of developing dashboards that are ultimately evaluated for their effectiveness.<br/></div> &copy; 2022, The Author(s).},

A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners.<br/> &copy; 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) skills are especially important in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where teacher guidance is scarce, and learners must engage in their learning process trying to succeed and achieve their learning goals. However, developing SRL strategies is difficult for learners given the autonomy that is required in this kind of courses. In order to support learners on this process, researchers have proposed a variety of tools designed to support certain aspects of self-regulation in online learning environments. Nevertheless, there is a lack of study to understand what the commonalities and differences in terms of design are, what the results in terms of the effect on learners&rsquo; self-regulation are and which of them could be applied in MOOCs. Those are the questions that should be further explored. In this paper we present a systematic literature review where 22 tools designed to support SRL in online environments were analyzed. Our findings indicate that: (1) most of the studies do not evaluate the effect on learners&rsquo; SRL strategies; (2) the use of interactive visualizations has a positive effect on learners&rsquo; motivation; (3) the use of the social comparison component has a positive effect on engagement and time management; and (4) there is a lack of models to match learners&rsquo; activity with the tools with SRL strategies. Finally, we present the lessons learned for guiding the community in the implementation of tools to support SRL strategies in MOOCs.<br/> &copy; 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {As computing becomes a mainstream discipline embedded in the school curriculum and acts as an enabler for an increasing range of academic disciplines in higher education, the literature on introductory programming is growing. Although there have been several reviews that focus on specific aspects of introductory programming, there has been no broad overview of the literature exploring recent trends across the breadth of introductory programming.  This paper is the report of an ITiCSE working group that conducted a systematic review in order to gain an overview of the introductory programming literature. Partitioning the literature into papers addressing the student, teaching, the curriculum, and assessment, we explore trends, highlight advances in knowledge over the past 15 years, and indicate possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {This paper aims to link student facing Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) to the corpus of research on Open Learner Models (OLMs), as both have similar goals. We conducted a systematic review of literature on OLMs and compared the results with a previously conducted review of LADs for learners in terms of (i) data use and modelling, (ii) key publication venues, (iii) authors and articles, (iv) key themes, and (v) system evaluation. We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60% are based on a single type of data; 33% use behavioral metrics; 39% support input from the user; 37% have complex models; and just 6% involve multiple applications. Key associated themes include intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and self-regulated learning. Notably, compared with LADs, OLM research is more likely to be interactive (81% of papers compared with 31% for LADs), report evaluations (76% versus 59%), use assessment data (100% versus 37%), provide a comparison standard for students (52% versus 38%), but less likely to use behavioral metrics, or resource use data (33% against 75% for LADs). In OLM work, there was a heightened focus on learner control and access to their own data.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a review of eight policies for learning analytics of relevance for higher education, and discusses how these policies have tried to address prominent challenges in the adoption of learning analytics, as identified in the literature. The results show that more considerations need to be given to establishing communication channels among stakeholders and adopting pedagogy-based approaches to learning analytics. It also reveals the shortage of guidance for developing data literacy among end-users and evaluating the progress and impact of learning analytics. Moreover, the review highlights the need to establish formalised guidelines to monitor the soundness, effectiveness, and legitimacy of learning analytics. As interest in learning analytics among higher education institutions continues to grow, this review will provide insights into policy and strategic planning for the adoption of learning analytics.},

abstract = {The use of games in the field of education is widespread. Currently, researchers are developing a model to assess the quality of games. The game evaluation model incorporates a multitude of diverse indicators and metrics. Nevertheless, the specific set of indicators and metrics that hold the utmost relevance for evaluating educational video games is yet to be determined. Differences in educational levels will impact learning objectives. The evaluation approach, instruments, and parameters vary significantly depending on the user's age and educational level. A conceptual framework is required to evaluate educational games, considering learning achievements based on user personas. This study proposes a systematic literature review to identify indicators for measuring the quality of educational games according to user personas. After searching the Scopus database, 159 papers were obtained. However, many of these papers solely discussed games and did not specifically address game evaluation. After further, it was found that thirty-two indicators were associated with game evaluation. These indicators are categorised into four variables: game, education, content, and user persona; some cited literature supports this categorisation method. In addition, the choice of indicators made by previous researchers demonstrates that the user persona element is central to measuring the quality of educational games. The existence of overly broad indicators causes numerous studies to diverge substantially; in this paper, we investigate the tools and methods utilised by user personas divided by education level.},

abstract = {Current Learning Analytics (LA) systems are primarily designed with University staff members as the target audience; very few are aimed at students, with almost none being developed with direct student involvement and undertaking a comprehensive evaluation. This paper describes a HEFCE funded project that has employed a variety of methods to engage students in the design, development and evaluation of a student facing LA dashboard. LA was integrated into the delivery of 4 undergraduate modules with 169 student sign-ups. The design of the dashboard uses a novel approach of trying to understand the reasons why students want to study at university and maps their engagement and predicted outcomes to these motivations, with weekly personalised notifications and feedback. Students are also given the choice of how to visualise the data either via a chart-based view or to be represented as themselves. A mixed-methods evaluation has shown that students' feelings of dependability and trust of the underlying analytics and data is variable. However, students were mostly positive about the usability and interface design of the system and almost all students once signed-up did interact with their LA. The majority of students could see how the LA system could support their learning and said that it would influence their behaviour. In some cases, this has had a direct impact on their levels of engagement. The main contribution of this paper is the transparent documentation of a User Centred Design approach that has produced forms of LA representation, recommendation and interaction design that go beyond those used in current similar systems and have been shown to motivate students and impact their learning behaviour.},

abstract = {Learning analytics can bridge the gap between learning sciences and data analytics, leveraging the expertise of both fields in exploring the vast amount of data generated in online learning environments. A typical learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners.},

abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) are becoming an increasingly popular way to provide students with personalised feedback. Despite the number of LADs being developed, significant research gaps exist around the student perspective, especially how students make sense of graphics provided in LADs, and how they intend to act on the feedback provided therein. This study employed a randomized-controlled trial to examine students' sense-making of LADs showing four different frames of reference, and to what extent the impact of LADs was mediated by baseline self-regulation. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative data analysis, the results revealed rather distinct patterns in students' sense-making across the four LADs. These patterns involved the intersection of visual salience and planned learning actions. However, collectively, across all four LADs a consistent theme emerged around students planned learning actions. This theme was classified as time and study environment management. A key finding of the study is that the use of LADs as a primary feedback process should be personalized and include training and support to aid student sensemaking.},

abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are becoming more prevalent in higher education to help students, faculty, and staff make data-informed decisions. Despite extensive research on the design and implementation of LADs, few studies have investigated their relation to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI). Excluding these issues in LAD research limits the potential benefits of LADs generally and risks reinforcing long-standing inequities in education. We conducted a critical literature review, identifying 45 relevant papers to answer three research questions: how is LAD research improving JEDI, ii. how might it maintain or exacerbate inequitable outcomes, and iii. what opportunities exist in this space to improve JEDI in higher education. Using thematic analysis, we identified four common themes: (1) participant identities and researcher positionality, (2) surveillance concerns, (3) implicit pedagogies, and (4) software development resources. While we found very few studies directly addressing or mentioning JEDI concepts, we used these themes to explore ways researchers could consider JEDI in their studies. Our investigation highlights several opportunities to intentionally incorporate JEDI into LAD research by sharing software resources and conducting cross-border collaborations, better incorporating user needs, and centering considerations of justice in LAD efforts to improve historical inequities.},

abstract = {In the era of data abundance, the ability to leverage data to assess the learning process is of great importance. Learning Analytics has been widely used and different approaches of deployment methods have been proposed, aiming to improve teaching and learning. Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD), as the most dominant method to communicate results to the educational stakeholders, are found to be very effective. However, building a flexible and informative LAD is a complex procedure that incorporates several consecutive steps. The data pipeline framework which is used as a blueprint for generating LADs in this paper offers an important abstraction that helps the non-technical users to appreciate the effectiveness of the approach, as for every insight and report that is generated by a data scientist, there are most probably large such pipelines that implement the underlying functionality. This paper discusses the utility of data pipelines and presents the implementation of a LAD based on a data pipeline in Distance Learning students’ data for summative assessment, along with some preliminary results.},

The emerging field of learning analytics is at the intersection of numerous academic disciplines, and therefore draws on a diversity of methodologies, theories and underpinning scientific assumptions. Through citation analysis and structured mapping we aimed to identify the emergence of trends and disciplinary hierarchies that are influencing the development of the field to date. The results suggest that there is some fragmentation in the major disciplines (computer science and education) regarding conference and journal representation. The analyses also indicate that the commonly cited papers are of a more conceptual nature than empirical research reflecting the need for authors to define the learning analytics space. An evaluation of the current state of learning analytics provides numerous benefits for the development of the field, such as a guide for under-represented areas of research and to identify the disciplines that may require more strategic and targeted support and funding opportunities.},

abstract = {Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) innovations make use of rapidly evolving sensing and artificial intelligence algorithms to collect rich data about learning activities that unfold in physical spaces. The analysis of these data is opening exciting new avenues for both studying and supporting learning. Yet, practical and logistical challenges commonly appear while deploying MMLA innovations “in-the-wild”. These can span from technical issues related to enhancing the learning space with sensing capabilities, to the increased complexity of teachers’ tasks. These practicalities have been rarely investigated. This article addresses this gap by presenting a set of lessons learnt from a 2-year human-centred MMLA in-the-wild study conducted with 399 students and 17 educators in the context of nursing education. The lessons learnt were synthesised into topics related to (i) technological/physical aspects of the deployment; (ii) multimodal data and interfaces; (iii) the design process; (iv) participation, ethics and privacy; and (v) sustainability of the deployment.},

This paper summarizes the main outcomes of a systematic literature review on learning dashboards, in the fields of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The query was run in five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically compare different dashboard design options.},

This is the primary conjecture for the study described in this paper. In our design-based research study, we design, test, and evaluate teacher-facing learning analytics for an online inquiry science unit on global climate change. We design our learning analytics in accordance with a socioconstructivism-based pedagogical framework, called Knowledge Integration, and the principles of learning analytics Implementation Design. Our methodology for the design process draws upon the principle of the Orchestrating for Learning Analytics framework to engage stakeholders (i.e. teachers, researchers, and developers). The resulting learning analytics were aligned to unit activities that engaged students in key aspects of the knowledge integration process. They provided teachers with actionable insight into their students' understanding at critical junctures in the learning process. We demonstrate the efficacy of the learning analytics in supporting the optimization of the unit's learning design. We conclude by synthesizing the principles that guided our design process into a framework for developing and evaluating learning analytics for learning design.},

abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are commonly designed to enhance student learning. However, they are not typically designed to meet the needs of teachers who use them in their classrooms. ITSs generate a wealth of analytics about student learning and behavior, opening a rich design space for real-time teacher support tools such as dashboards. Whereas real-time dashboards for teachers have become popular with many learning technologies, we are not aware of projects that have designed dashboards for ITSs based on a broad investigation of teachers' needs. We conducted design interviews with ten middle school math teachers to explore their needs for on-the-spot support during blended class sessions, as a first step in a user-centered design process of a real-time dashboard. Based on multi-methods analyses of this interview data, we identify several opportunities for ITSs to better support teachers' needs, noting that the analytics commonly generated by existing teacher support tools do not strongly align with the analytics teachers expect to be most useful. We highlight key tensions and tradeoffs in the design of such real-time supports for teachers, as revealed by "Speed Dating" possible futures with teachers. This paper has implications for our ongoing co-design of a real-time dashboard for ITSs, as well as broader implications for the design of ITSs that can effectively collaborate with teachers in classroom settings.},

abstract = {IoT-based multimodal learning analytics promises to obtain an in-depth understanding of the learning process. It provides the insights for not only the explicit learning indicators but also the implicit attributes of learners, based on which further potential learning support can be timely provided in both physical and cyber world accordingly. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the existing studies for examining the empirical evidences on the usage of IoT data in education and the capabilities of multimodal analysis to provide useful insights for smarter education. In particular, we classify the multimodal data into four categories based on the data sources (data from digital, physical, physiological and environmental spaces). Moreover, we propose a concept framework for better understanding the current state of the filed and summarize the insights into six main themes (learner behavior understanding, learner affection computing, smart learning environment, learning performance prediction, group collaboration modeling and intelligent feedback) based on the objectives for intelligent learning. The associations between different combinations of data modalities and various learning indicators are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges and future directions are also presented from three aspects.},

abstract = {Practical programming competencies are critical to the success in computer science (CS) education and go-to-market of fresh graduates. Acquiring the required level of skills is a long journey of discovery, trial and error, and optimization seeking through a broad range of programming activities that learners must perform themselves. It is not reasonable to consider that teachers could evaluate all attempts that the average learner should develop multiplied by the number of students enrolled in a course, much less in a timely, deep, and fair fashion. Unsurprisingly, exploring the formal structure of programs to automate the assessment of certain features has long been a hot topic among CS education practitioners. Assessing a program is considerably more complex than asserting its functional correctness, as the proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature over the past decades indicates. Program efficiency, behavior, and readability, among many other features, assessed either statically or dynamically, are now also relevant for automatic evaluation. The outcome of an evaluation evolved from the primordial Boolean values to information about errors and tips on how to advance, possibly taking into account similar solutions. This work surveys the state of the art in the automated assessment of CS assignments, focusing on the supported types of exercises, security measures adopted, testing techniques used, type of feedback produced, and the information they offer the teacher to understand and optimize learning. A new era of automated assessment, capitalizing on static analysis techniques and containerization, has been identified. Furthermore, this review presents several other findings from the conducted review, discusses the current challenges of the field, and proposes some future research directions.},

abstract = {To overcome the skills gap between industry demands and learning outcomes achieved by graduates in higher computing education, many Bachelor programs integrate some form of internship in their curriculum; students are assumed to encounter authentic tasks and recent technologies in the workplace. In practice, however, educators often do not know specifically which tasks their students perform and which technologies they use, mainly due to the distance between coach and student during the work placement and the lack of cohort-based overviews of activities performed in internships. In this study, we gathered and analyzed workplace activity data of 54 students over the course of their third-year semester-long internships in the computing industry. We performed descriptive analyses to gain insight into i) which categories of activities students performed most (programming, research and documentation) and ii) which of the activity categories they find most difficult (research, documentation (both academic and IT) and implementation/configuration). Subsequent text analysis gives us insight into students' perceptions of the categories used to label activities (testing, research, meetings, and academic documentation are congruous) and which technologies were used most by these students. Based on the results, we conclude it is feasible to use user-generated data to get insights into workplace activities of computing interns. The quality of this user-generated data does hamper us in drawing certain conclusions. Further research is needed with improved data quality and volume in order to obtain more generalizable results.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Many software development organisations today adopt global software engineering (GSE) and agile models; requiring software engineers to collaborate and develop software in flexible, distributed, online teams. However, many employers have expressed concern that graduates lack teamwork skills and one of the most commonly occurring problems with GSE models are issues with project management. Team managers and educators often oversee a number of teams and the large corpus of data, in combination with agile models, make it difficult to efficiently assess factors such as team role distribution and emotional climate.Current methods and tools for monitoring software engineering (SE) teamwork in both industry and education settings typically focus on member contributions, reflection, or product outcomes, which are limited in terms of real-time feedback and accurate behavioural analysis. We have created a dashboard that extracts and communicates team role distribution and team emotion information in real-time. Our proof of concept provides a real-time analysis of teamwork discussions and visualises team member emotions, the roles they have adopted and overall team sentiment during the course of a collaborative problem-solving project. We demonstrate and discuss how such a tool could be useful for SE team management and training and the development of teamwork skills in SE university courses.},

abstract = {Improving driver behaviors through driving education and coaching is well-recognized as being necessary and efficient for driving safely and reducing traffic accidents, as they promise to reduce human factors accounting for most of the crash involvements. Driver education programs are currently widely employed in many countries, ensuring that the necessary procedural driving skills and competencies are imparted during these processes, to make more skilled drivers. However, making people more skilled drivers does not make them safer ones, the effectiveness of driving education is greatly restricted by the limited amount of actual supervised driving involved and the absence of individualized feedback. To this aim, driving coaching emerges as a more practical alternative to develop safely driving by proactively providing coaching feedback to enhance skills and cultivate corrective behaviors, with the recent technological developments in intelligent vehicles and transportation. This paper presents a systematic review of the existing studies for examining the empirical evidences on the various coaching explorations for the development of drivers’ procedural driving skills. In particular, we propose a taxonomy to classify existing driving coaching into four categories, and explore the answers to three questions: what types, when and how the different kinds of driving coaching are provided and delivered. Finally, the challenges and future directions are also presented from three aspects.},

abstract = {Information dashboards are extremely useful tools to exploit knowledge. Dashboards enable users to reach insights and to identify patterns within data at-a-glance. However, dashboards present a series of characteristics and configurations that could not be optimal for every user, thus requiring the modification or variation of its features to fulfill specific user requirements. This variation process is usually referred to as customization, personalization or adaptation, depending on how this variation process is achieved. Given the great number of users and the exponential growth of data sources, tailoring an information dashboard is not a trivial task, as several solutions and configurations could arise. To analyze and understand the current state-of-the-art regarding tailored information dashboards, a systematic mapping has been performed. This mapping focus on answering questions regarding how existing dashboard solutions in the literature manage the customization, personalization and/or adaptation of its elements to produce tailored displays.},

abstract = {Interactive dashboards enable viewing and interacting with complex underlying data using visualisations such as charts, tables, maps, or even text typically on a single display. By bringing the most important information in a single place, dashboards enable performance monitoring and support decision making. Although nowadays dashboards are widely adopted in many domains, they involve challenges that prevent users from utilising them as they were intended. For example, having a dashboard with too much data can negatively affect decision making and lead to misleading interpretation. Through this research, we identify and investigate the challenges associated with dashboards, what users do in response to those challenges, and what adaptations can be applied to mitigate these challenges. Consequently, we aim to examine and evaluate a set of adaptation techniques that can improve the experience of users interacting with dashboards.},

The main objectives we aim to address are 1) Identification of the most common and most significant HCI usability challenges in XAI; 2) Identification of good and reusable solutions for recognised HCI challenges in literature and existing XAI solutions, and 3) Their definition in the form of the design patterns. A catalogue of graphical user interface design patterns (i.e. reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems with a given context) in XAI is proposed. Expected benefits of the thesis include facilitating communication and collaboration between researchers and practitioners by providing shared vocabulary and proven design patterns, enhancing trust and accountability of AI solutions, promoting user-centred design and facilitating the evaluation and accelerating the maturation of XAI.},

abstract = {Welcome to ITiCSE 2015 in Vilnius!The ITiCSE conference celebrates its 20th anniversary in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and the geographical center of Europe, so declared in 1989 by scientists of the French National Institute of Geography.ITiCSE will be held on July 6--8, starting on Lithuania's Statehood Day (July 6). This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15--17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques &amp; courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\l{}aw, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!},

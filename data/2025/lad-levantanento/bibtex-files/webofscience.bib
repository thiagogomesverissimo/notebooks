Abstract = {In this paper a learning analytics dashboard for MOOCs is proposed. It
   visualises the progress of learners' activity taking into account
   navigation, social interactions and interaction with educational
   resources. This approach was tested with the MOOCs created by the
   University Autonoma of Madrid (Spain) in the edX platform. Nowadays, the
   dashboard is being improved taking into account the received feedback
   from MOOCs instructors and assistants. Finally, a new version is
   presented to work along with edX and Open edX.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe about a kind of data flow design that between
   ubiquitous learning log system called SCROLL and learning analytics and
   visualizing system called Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD). SCROLL is
   a ubiquitous learning system what is logging students' learning
   behaviors data in database, and SCROLL can provide students suitable
   learning method and location to learn efficiently. Lots of paper show
   that it is appreciate to share the learning data in SCROLL to the other
   learning analytics system like LTI, Bookroll, Moodle and so on. Learning
   Analytics Dashboard (LAD) is also a learning data analytics and
   visualizing system. So share students' learning data from SCROLL to LAD
   to show and help students to know their students' learning situation is
   the proposal of this paper.},

Abstract = {With the rise of online learning platforms, the need for effective
   learning analytics (LA) has become critical for teachers. However, the
   development of traditional LA dashboards often requires technical
   expertise and a certain level of data literacy, preventing many teachers
   from integrating LA dashboards effectively and flexibly into their
   teaching practice. This paper explores the development of a self-service
   teacher-facing learning analytics dashboard powered by large language
   models (LLMs), for improving teaching practices. By leveraging LLMs, the
   self-service system aims to simplify the implementation of data queries
   and visualizations, allowing teachers to create personalized LA
   dashboards using natural languages. This study also investigates the
   capabilities of LLMs in generating charts for LA dashboards and
   evaluates the effectiveness of the self-service system through usability
   tests with 15 teachers. Preliminary findings suggest that LLMs
   demonstrate high capabilities in generating charts for LA dashboards,
   and the LLM-powered self-service system can effectively address
   participating teachers' pedagogical needs for LA. This research
   contributes to the ongoing research on the intersection of LLMs and
   education, emphasizing the potential of self-service systems to empower
   teachers in daily teaching practices.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics provides a potential for adapting learning, teaching
   and knowledge testing processes to individual needs. One of the ways of
   using learning analytics is a dashboard for providing feedback to
   students and teachers. This paper presents the development and
   evaluation of the learning analytics dashboard for students (LAD-S). The
   LAD-S displays three views: a look at student success, system activities
   and prediction based on machine learning algorithms. We have used LAD-S
   as a part of Moodle online courses, one during the second semester in
   the 2020/2021, and the other two during the first semester in the
   2021/2022. A survey was designed to examine students' opinion about the
   LAD-S that included student's self-awareness, influence of the dashboard
   on learning effectiveness, satisfaction with the type of data collected,
   usefulness and ease-of-use, intention to use the learning analytics
   dashboard. Data from 33 undergraduate and graduate students were
   collected. The results have shown that students are satisfied with all
   examined aspects of the LAD-S above the average. Students express the
   greatest satisfaction for ease of use (M = 3.79), clarity of collected
   data (M = 3.6), usefulness (M = 3.6), SUS questionnaire ( M = 3.6),
   behavioral intention (M = 3.4) and satisfaction with individual
   functions of LAD-S (M= 3.4). Lower, yet above-average satisfaction was
   obtained for the impact of the LAD-S on more effective learning (M =
   3.2); intention to use (M = 3.3) and satisfaction with the possibility
   of behavioral changes (M = 3.1). To verify the reliability of the
   measures used, the Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was
   calculated for each scale. Satisfactory reliability of all measures used
   was obtained, with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.704 for the SUS
   questionnaire to 0.942 for the ease-of-use measure.},

Abstract = {Educational games are games explicitly designed with educational
   purposes and aims to balance learning and playing. These educational
   games help people to learn and improve as they play. However, there is a
   lack of gameplay monitoring process whereby the real-time information of
   game progress is not being reflected. Most of the existing educational
   games do not consolidate with learning analytics dashboards which leads
   to no visualization of gameplay information and inadequate gameplay
   analysis. When players have information on how to improve their
   performance, they will be encouraged to revisit the game. Hence, an
   educational game with learning analytics dashboard, ChemistLab, is
   developed for learners to learn chemistry. The dashboard will visualize
   the performance and skills changes overtime which reflect the players'
   learning patterns and strategies used to improve their performance for
   better learning. The learning content of the game is extracted from the
   Malaysia Upper Secondary Education (Form 4) Chemistry syllabus. The
   expected output of the game is to allow users to observe their gameplay
   performance through the dashboard and gaining new knowledge through the
   game with the achievement of learning objectives.},

Title = {Social comparison in learning analytics dashboard supporting motivation
   and academic achievement},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {A promising contribution of Learning Analytics is the presentation of a
   learner's own learning behaviour and achievements via dashboards, often
   in comparison to peers, with the goal of improving self-regulated
   learning. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the impact
   of these dashboards and few designs are informed by theory. Many
   dashboard designs struggle to translate awareness of learning processes
   into actual self -regulated learning. In this study we investigate a
   Learning Analytics dashboard based on existing evidence on social
   comparison to support motivation, metacognition and academic
   achievement. Motivation plays a key role in whether learners will engage
   in self-regulated learning in the first place. Social comparison can be
   a significant driver in increasing motivation. We performed two
   randomised controlled interventions in different higher -education
   courses, one of which took place online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Students were shown their current and predicted performance in a course
   alongside that of peers with similar goal grades. The sample of peers
   was selected in a way to elicit slight upward comparison. We found that
   the dashboard successfully pro-motes extrinsic motivation and leads to
   higher academic achievement, indicating an effect of dashboard exposure
   on learning behaviour, despite an absence of effects on metacognition.
   These results provide evidence that carefully designed social
   comparison, rooted in theory and empirical evidence, can be used to
   boost motivation and performance. Our dashboard is a successful example
   of how social comparison can be implemented in Learning Analytics
   Dashboards.},

Abstract = {The learning analytics dashboard (LAD) is a newly developed learning
   support tool for virtual classrooms that is believed to allow students
   to review their online learning behavior patterns intuitively through
   the provision of visual information. The purpose of this study was to
   empirically validate the effects of LAD. An experimental study was
   conducted with a dashboard treatment group and a control group. The
   researchers developed a LAD and evaluated its effectiveness on the
   sample of 151 college students at a private university located in Korea,
   who were taking the online course titled ``Management Statistics{''} in
   the first semester of 2014. The following results were obtained. First,
   the students who received dashboard treatment presented higher final
   score than those who did not. Second, the dashboard usage frequency, as
   measured by the number of times the dashboard was opened, did not have a
   significant impact on learning achievement. However, a slightly positive
   correlation between satisfaction with LAD and learning achievement was
   observed. Further analysis indicated that learners who used the
   dashboard only a few times showed relatively high satisfaction with LAD.
   On the other hand, high academic achievers who opened LAD relatively
   frequently showed lower satisfaction with dashboard. The results guide
   that LAD should be revised in a way to motivate learners consistently
   and support learners who have different academic achievement levels. The
   study discusses the further research tasks in terms of LAD development
   as an effective and personalized feedback tool to improve learners'
   academic achievement.},

Abstract = {A Learning Analytics Dashboard is a quick and efficient way for
   instructors to track the activities of students. In massive online
   learning scenarios like an international robotics competition, a
   dashboard is a critical tool for instructors to ensure continuous
   engagement of participants. Previous research on learning analytics
   dashboards focused on the effectiveness of dashboards and learning
   analytics on students along with factors affecting its success. This
   research discusses a dashboard developed for a massive robotics
   competition through which each year thousands of students are trained in
   engineering skills in an online Project Based Learning approach. The
   dashboard is developed using the dataset for the competition conducted
   during September 2020 to April 2021 in which more than 10,000
   undergraduate students from 572 academic institutions across 7 countries
   participated. Team characteristics like demographics, feedback, scores,
   online activity, etc. are considered to cluster teams and develop models
   to predict the retention of participants. The Machine Learning (ML)
   model was able to achieve an accuracy of 80.7\% and a recall value of
   83.9\% to identify dropping teams. Clustering provided insights on how
   these characteristics affected the performance of participants. These
   predictions along with participant engagement and feedback data was
   displayed on the dashboard. This visualization helps instructors
   identify teams requiring guidance or scaffolds to continue
   participation. Feedback from instructors shows the dashboard to be a
   promising tool for effectively managing massive online competitions.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards are becoming increasingly common tools for
   providing feedback to learners. However, there is limited empirical
   evidence regarding the effects of learning analytics dashboard design
   features on learners' cognitive load, particularly in digital learning
   environments. To address this gap, we developed goal-based, explanatory,
   and instructional learning analytics dashboards in authentic online
   courses based on cognitive load theory, and evaluated the effects of the
   three information designs on cognitive load and performance. The study
   adopted a quasi-experimental approach over a semester-long course,
   involving 93 learners divided into four groups, each provided with
   differently designed information on their learning analytics dashboard.
   The results show that the incorporation of goals, explanations, and
   instructional information as support elements in the learning analytics
   dashboard did not have a significant impact on learners' cognitive load
   and performance. Both cognitive load and learning performance results
   were consistent and mutually validating. Additionally, the study found
   that compared to a control group without additional information, the
   group using the explanatory dashboard experienced an increase in germane
   cognitive load, and evidenced the effectiveness of explanatory
   information design. Overall, this study provides important insights for
   the enhancement and practical design of learning analytics dashboards
   and feedback methods.},

Abstract = {Student-facing learning analytics dashboards (LADs) provide
   visualizations of course-related information to help students understand
   and personalize their educational practices. As such, they can be viewed
   as a meta-cognitive tool that enables awareness, self-reflection and
   sensemaking of academic performance. While student-facing LADs are
   becoming a standard feature in educational software, questions have been
   raised about students' willingness to adopt LADs and their ability to
   interpret feedback provided by student-facing LADs. The extent to which
   student-facing LADs can broadly improve educational outcomes depends, in
   part, on students' ability to readily incorporate LAD usage in their
   educational workflows.
   This study investigates the use of a student-facing LAD, My Learning
   Analytics (MyLA), over the span of one semester in a university
   introductory science course. MyLA draws data from the campus learning
   management system (Canvas) and displays three visualizations designed to
   provide students with actionable information. Adoption and use of MyLA
   was voluntary. As an exploratory study of MyLA's use in an introductory
   science course, this work addresses three research questions: i) What
   are the characteristics of students that use MyLA?, ii) How do students
   make use of MyLA in their coursework?, and iii) What patterns of use are
   exhibited by more frequent MyLA users? The results indicate that given
   the opportunity to use a student-facing LAD, 33\% of students made
   repeated use of the tool. Demographic data (e.g., gender,
   domestic/international student) did not predict MyLA usage but
   significant differences in mean cumulative GPA were found between
   non-MyLA users and MyLA users. Broad patterns of MyLA use were aligned
   with major assessments in the course (e.g., MyLA was used more often
   around exam dates) and the grade distribution view was the most commonly
   accessed. Among the most highly active MyLA users, two distinct profiles
   were identified: aware and sensemakers. Aware users made use of the
   dashboard on more than 12 distinct days across the course, primarily
   around exam dates, and stated that they accessed the dashboard to
   compare their performance with others. Sensemakers made frequent use of
   all three MyLA views multiple times over the semester to monitor their
   own progress, compare their grades to others, and check what materials
   other students had viewed.
   LADs such as MyLA allow students to leverage what they already know
   about course assessment in their interpretation of the data presented,
   easing adoption and deployment of a student-facing LAD in higher
   education. As MyLA does not require that students have any additional
   training to interpret the visualizations they provide, LADs can readily
   be employed by students in introductory computing and engineering
   courses to provide them with feedback to help them plan for, monitor,
   and evaluate their academic progress.},

Title = {Designing a Human-centred Learning Analytics Dashboard In-use},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in applying human-centred design methods to
   create learning analytics (LA) systems, most efforts have concentrated
   on initial design phases, with limited exploration of how LA tools and
   practices can co-evolve during the actual learning and teaching
   activities. This paper examines how a human-centred LA dashboard can be
   further refined and adapted by teachers while actively using it in a
   real-world scenario (i.e., design-in-use),beyond its intended design
   (i.e., design-for-use). We use instrumental genesis as a theoretical
   lens to analyze the temporary and permanent instrumentalization of
   design features and individual and collective instrumentation of the LA
   dashboard. The analysis of semi-structured individual interviews with
   five nursing teachers who used an LA dashboard to guide team reflections
   with 224 students (56 teams) revealed technical and pedagogical changes
   that occurred in both the system's features (instrumentalization) and
   teaching practices (instrumentation). We found that teachers adopted the
   LA dashboard beyond initially intended ways by (i) providing emotional
   support with the analytics, (ii) reducing details in AI-powered data
   visualizations for easier comprehension, (iii) creating data narratives
   to address data limitations, and (iv) collectively developing new
   practices to use the LA dashboard for co-teaching. Therefore, teachers'
   design-in-use of the LA dashboard highlights the ongoing need for design
   improvements to address challenges posed by dynamic data and complex
   algorithms underlying AI and analytics interfaces.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the design, development, and implementation of
   a Learning Analytics (LA) dashboard in the area of Higher Education
   (HE). The dashboard meets the demands of the different stakeholders,
   maximizes the mainstreaming potential and transferability to other
   contexts, and is developed in the path of Open Source. The research
   concentrates on developing an appropriate concept to fulfil its
   objectives and finding a suitable technology stack. Therefore, we
   determine the capabilities and functionalities of the dashboard for the
   different stakeholders. This is of significant importance as it
   identifies which data can be collected, which feedback can be given, and
   which functionalities are provided. A key approach in the development of
   the dashboard is the modularity. This leads us to a design with three
   modules: the data collection, the search and information processing, and
   the data presentation. Based on these modules, we present the steps of
   finding a fitting Open Source technology stack for our concept and
   discuss pros and cons trough out the process.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are gaining popularity as a
   platform for providing students with insights into their learning
   behaviour patterns in online environments. Existing LAD studies are
   mainly centred on displaying students' online behaviours with simplistic
   descriptive insights. Only a few studies have integrated predictive
   components, while none possess the ability to explain how the predictive
   models work and how they have arrived at specific conclusions for a
   given student. A further gap exists within existing LADs with respect to
   prescriptive analytics that generate data-driven feedback to students on
   how to adjust their learning behaviour. The LAD in this study attempts
   to address this gap and integrates a full spectrum of current analytics
   technologies for sense-making while anchoring them within theoretical
   educational frameworks. This study's LAD (SensEnablr) was evaluated for
   its effectiveness in impacting learning in a student cohort at a
   tertiary institution. Our findings demonstrate that student engagement
   with learning technologies and course resources increased significantly
   immediately following interactions with the dashboard. Meanwhile,
   results showed that the dashboard boosted the respondents' learning
   motivation levels and that the novel analytics insights drawn from
   predictive and prescriptive analytics were beneficial to their learning.
   This study, therefore, has implications for future research when
   investigating student outcomes and optimizing student learning using LAD
   technologies.},

   A concrete experimentation, through the design of a learning timeline

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards constitute an effective tool for
   monitoring learning activities that take place in online learning
   environments. Thanks to dashboards, teachers can promptly detect low
   levels of student engagement in given tasks, incorrect usage of a
   system, and other types of pedagogically relevant information, which
   helps them to better support students in achieving their learning
   objectives. This study describes the integration of a dashboard in an
   online learning system. The system includes a tool that guides students
   in the creation of highly informative bilingual glossaries, a service
   that traces student searches on the web for reference material, and a
   service that tracks student interactions with the glossary. The data
   thus collected are selectively displayed in the newly developed
   dashboard. The dashboard was specifically designed to allow teachers to
   monitor the students' approaches to glossary building and to provide
   individual remedial feedback, if necessary. It was also intended to spur
   students to keep on a par with the rest of the class, by seeing their
   status compared to the rest of the class. The system was tested with two
   groups of university students specializing in interpreting, and two
   different teachers. The results of the experiments suggest that this
   integrated system manages to achieve its goals and provides students and
   teachers of interpreting with an innovative online tool that concretely
   fosters and supports vocabulary building.},

Abstract = {In this article, the authors describe a prototype of a Learning
   Analytics Dashboard (LAD) for educators. It is based on the analysis of
   pedagogical actions and taking into the process and learning style of
   students in an online environment based on learning analytics (LA). A
   description of the Dashboard structure, divided into levels and
   categories based on available learning analytics, will allow the
   educator to dive deeper into the online course themselves and explore
   more. It will also allow them to determine the level of student
   performance, identify gaps in learning materials, and research student
   data.
   The authors have identified further directions for the development of a
   LAD for a professor, including modeling algorithms for researching
   student behavior and learning style using Artificial Intelligence and
   presenting LA in a visualized form. This paper shows the stages of
   creating a professor's LAD prototype as a functional part of the
   adaptive learning system in the HASKI-System to analyze visual
   information obtained from LA and the possibilities to monitor the
   learning process, learning progress, student activity, and make
   decisions on careful intervention in the students' learning process.},

Abstract = {The Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) is an application to show
   students' online behavior patterns in a virtual learning environment.
   This supporting tool works by tracking students' log-files, mining
   massive amounts of data to find meaning, and visualizing the results so
   they can be comprehended at a glance. This paper reviews previously
   developed applications to analyze their features. Based on the
   implications from the review of previous studies as well as a
   preliminary investigation on the need for such tools, an early version
   of the LAD was designed and developed. Also, in order to improve the
   LAD, a usability test incorporating a stimulus recall interview was
   conducted with 38 college students in two blended learning classes.
   Evaluation of this tool was performed in an experimental research
   setting with a control group and additional surveys were conducted
   asking students' about perceived usefulness, conformity, level of
   understanding of graphs, and their behavioral changes. The results
   indicated that this newly developed learning analytics tool did not
   significantly impact on their learning achievement. However, lessons
   learned from the usability and pilot tests support that visualized
   information impacts on students' understanding level; and the overall
   satisfaction with dashboard plays as a covariant that impacts on both
   the degree of understanding and students' perceived change of behavior.
   Taking in the results of the tests and students' openended responses, a
   scaffolding strategy to help them understand the meaning of the
   information displayed was included in each sub section of the dashboard.
   Finally, this paper discusses future directions in regard to improving
   LAD so that it better supports students' learning performance, which
   might be helpful for those who develop learning analytics applications
   for students.},

Title = {A learning analytics dashboard to support students' reflection on
   collaboration},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Background: Dashboards play a prominent role in learning analytics (LA)
   research. In collaboration activities, dashboards can show traces of
   team participation. They are often evaluated based on students'
   perceived satisfaction and engagement with the dashboard. However, there
   is a notable methodological gap in understanding how these dashboards
   support the nuanced process of student reflection. ObjectiveThis paper
   presents empirical evidence on how students from high and low-performing
   groups reflect individually on their performance while using a Learning
   Analytics Dashboard (LAD). Methods: We address this in the context of
   education in healthcare, wherein we captured actions and positioning
   data from a simulation-based collaborative activity and generated a
   collaborative LAD. A total of 41 nursing students were invited to
   participate in a post-hoc semi-structured individual interview to use a
   collaborative LAD while answering a set of prompts to reflect on their
   individual and group performance. Students' reflections were coded and
   analysed using Bain's 5R reflection framework. We used epistemic network
   analysis to capture the dynamic reflection process and to understand the
   connections between the reflection stages (from low to high). We
   compared how different these connections were for students in high and
   low-performing groups. Results and Conclusions: Our results revealed
   that most students were only able to achieve low and middle stages of
   reflection. Yet, students in low-performing groups predominantly
   followed low-to-middle stages of reflection. In contrast, students from
   high-performing groups demonstrated the ability to transition between
   low-to-middle and low-to-high stages of reflection. Based on these
   findings, we discuss implications for both research and practice,
   particularly emphasising the necessity to scaffold reflection when using
   LADs.},

Abstract = {Online Judge (OJ) is an important aid for programming learning that can
   help students evaluate learning effects in real-time, while teachers can
   adjust practice tasks in time according to the records of the tool. With
   these advantages, OJ shows great value for promoting teaching and
   learning in programming. The existing OJ system usually only provides
   information such as problem status list and recent rank list. However,
   it is unable to provide teachers with more fine-grained analysis
   information, such as the distribution of students' incorrect responses
   and level of knowledge mastery. And it also cannot provide students with
   effective comparative information on their learning status. This
   research developed a visual learning analytics dashboard named VisOJ for
   the OJ system, which includes two types of user interfaces: teacher and
   student. The teacher interface presents students' learning status and
   ranking trends, which help teachers monitor and give feedback on their
   learning activities. The student interface provides views such as error
   type analysis and evaluation, which promote students' self-reflection
   and self-regulation. Preliminary case studies and expert interviews
   prove the usability of the dashboard. In the end, we summarize our main
   work and suggest future research directions.},

   the learning experience for students. However, despite this effort,
   significant research gaps still exist around utilizing educational data

   comprehensive impact of data-informed feedback on students. In this
   study, a learning analytics dashboard was designed to provide students
   with actionable feedback to advance their self-regulated learning skills
   and improve their course performance. A rigorous inquiry using mixed
   methods was also conducted to study the dashboard's impacts on students.
   It found that students' use of the dashboard was positively correlated
   with their course performance, and those who viewed the dashboard had
   higher course ranks. In addition, it showed that students' use of the
   dashboard was positively correlated with their homework submission time,
   and those who viewed the dashboard submitted homework earlier as the
   course progressed. The inquiry also revealed that students had mixed
   feelings about the dashboard, including motivation and anxiety.},

   platform for college teachers and conducts a preliminary evaluation with
   18 participants. Results show their largely positive ratings on five
   criteria (e.g., perceived usefulness, ease of use, and behavioral
   changes) and offer feedback for further refinements of the LAD. This
   study will improve our understanding of LA-enabled teacher online

Abstract = {Student outcomes in US higher education exhibit deep and persistent
   inequities. The continued underperformance of historically marginalized
   students remains a serious concern across higher education, reflected in
   increasing efforts among institutions to infuse diversity, equity, and
   inclusion into their academic and social communities. Yet despite
   widespread recognition of these inequities, few studies in the learning
   analytics literature engage in practical ways with issues of educational
   equity or DEI considerations. In this paper, we share our work
   supporting a large college ` s strategic DEI goals through the creation
   of a Course Diversity Dashboard informed by research into how students `
   study behaviors and performance interact with their gender and ethnic
   identities to impact course outcomes. The dashboard enables users to
   explore inequalities in course outcomes and take concrete actions to
   improve student study strategies, time management, and prior knowledge.
   Results from our research revealed the existence of previously hidden
   learner inequities in all courses included in our study as well as
   critical differences in underrepresented minority students ` prior
   knowledge. And while we did not find evidence of meaningful differences
   in the study behaviors of student subgroups, our findings further
   validate the effectiveness of evidence-informed study strategies in an
   authentic educational setting.},

Abstract = {The use of Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) has gained popularity as
   a means of supporting the self-regulated learning (SRL) skills of
   learners in large-scale online courses. Despite many studies proposing
   LAD designs, LADs are often criticized for their weak theoretical
   foundations, lack of actionable feedback, and tendency to encourage
   excessive social comparison. Furthermore, many LAD designs have missed
   context-specific details. Hence, it is not uncommon for some dashboard
   designs to have negative effects on learners, such as discouragement or
   anxiety. In this study, we designed the Meta-LAD, a LAD that supports
   SRL processes using theoretical and contextual foundations. We used data
   from a credit-bearing Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on supply chain
   management to contextually ground the dashboard. We performed usability
   testing interviews to evaluate the design and confirmed that the
   Meta-LAD could fulfill learners' needs for references and actionable
   feedback. This study contributes to the field of online learning by
   presenting a theoretically grounded and contextually specific LAD design
   process. This paper expands the understanding of how to support SRL in
   MOOCs.},

Abstract = {Online learning has become an everyday form of learning for many
   students across different disciplines, including STEM subjects in the
   setting of higher education. Studying in these settings requires
   students to self-regulate their learning to a higher degree as compared
   to campus-based education. A vital aspect of self-regulated learning is
   the application of goal-setting strategies. Universities act to support
   students' goal-setting through the achievement of course learning
   outcomes, which work both as a promise and metric of academic
   achievement. However, a lack of clear integration between course
   activities and course learning outcomes leaves a dissonance between
   students' study efforts and the course progress. This demo study
   presents a student-centered learning analytics dashboard aimed at
   assisting students in their achievement of course learning goals in the
   setting of STEM higher education. The dashboard was designed using a
   design science methodological approach. Thirty-seven students have
   contributed to its development and evaluation during different stages of
   the design process, including the conceptual iterative design and
   prototyping. The preliminary results show that students found the tool
   to be easy to use and useful for the achievement of the course goals.},

Abstract = {The advanced learning analytics research of the last years converges
   with the industry demand to enhance famous learning management systems
   with learning analytics capabilities promoting the efficiency of higher
   education. The exploitation of big volume learning data, is a critical
   challenge for the design of personalized curricula and learning
   experiences. The purpose of this research paper is to communicate a
   framework for Learning Analytics aiming to support the integrated
   management of end to-end learning data. We present the research
   foundations of a research prototype for the integration of a Learning
   Analytics Dashboard: The AMBA Prototype with famous Learning Management
   Systems. Finally, we present the main findings of an empirical study
   that proves the capacity of learning analytics to enhance the learners'
   ecosystem with value adding learning services. The proposed framework
   exploits cognitive computing for the enhancement of decision making in
   education by proving the capacity of Learning Analytics to reveal hidden
   patterns of learners' behaviour and attitude. (C) 2018 Published by

Abstract = {Nowadays, the higher education institutions experience the problem of
   the student drop-out. In response to this problem, universities started
   employing analytical dashboards and educational data mining methods such
   as machine learning, to detect students at risk of failing their
   studies. In this paper, we present interactive web-based Learning
   Analytics dashboard - Analyst, which has been successfully deployed at
   Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (FME), Czech Technical University in
   Prague. The dashboard provides academic teaching staff with the
   opportunity to analyse student-related data from various sources in
   multiple ways to identify those, who might have difficulties to complete
   their degree. For this purpose, multiple analytical dashboard views have
   been implemented. It includes summary statistic, study progression
   graph, and credit completion probabilities graph. In addition, users
   have the option to export all analysis related graphs for the future
   use. Based on the outcomes provided by the Analyst, the university
   successfully ran the interventions on the selected at-risk students and
   significantly increased the retention rate in the first study year.},

Title = {Learning Analytics Dashboard Design and Evaluation to Support Student
   Self-Regulation of Study Behaviour},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {For university students, self-regulation of study behaviour is
   important. However, students are not always capable of effective
   self-regulation. Providing study behaviour information via a learning
   analytics dashboard (LAD) may support phases within self-regulated
   learning (SRL). However, it is unclear what information a LAD should
   provide, how to present information in a usable manner, and what the
   information's perceived usefulness is in supporting self-regulation of
   study behaviour. This study entails a sequential mixed design: assessing
   information needs in focus groups (n=7), exploring usability via
   think-aloud interviews (n=8), assessing usability with the System
   Usability Scale (n=42), and assessing perceived usefulness via
   interviews (n=16). Results showed that students and tutors agreed on the
   relevance of the constructs chosen from literature but differed in
   ranking the importance of new constructs. Usability exploration led to
   several design improvements. Perceived usefulness assessment showed the
   LAD supported the appraisal of study behaviour. A need for reference
   frames to facilitate data interpretation was vocalized. Impacts on study
   behaviour varied, possibly because preparatory activities were not used.
   Impact could be improved by further integrating the LAD into existing
   learning processes.},

Abstract = {With the increased capability of learning analytics in higher education,
   more institutions are developing or implementing student dashboards.
   Despite the emergence of dashboards as an easy way to present data to
   students, students have had limited involvement in the dashboard
   development process. As part of a larger program of research examining
   student and academic perceptions of learning analytics, we report here
   on work in progress exploring student perceptions of dashboards and
   student preferences for dashboard features. First, we present findings
   on higher education students' attitudes towards learning analytic
   dashboards resulting from four focus groups (N = 41). Thematic analysis
   of the focus group transcripts identified five key themes relating to
   dashboards: `provide everyone with the same learning opportunities', `to
   compare or not to compare', `dashboard privacy', `automate alerts' and
   `make it meaningful-give me a customizable dashboard'. Next we present
   findings from a content analysis of students' drawings of dashboards
   demonstrating that students are interested in features that support
   learning opportunities, provide comparisons to peers and are meaningful
   to the student. Finally, we present preliminary findings from a survey
   of higher education students, reinforcing students' desire to choose
   whether to have a dashboard and to be able to customize their
   dashboards. These findings highlight the potential for providing
   students with some level of control over learning analytics as a means
   to increasing self-regulated learning and academic achievement. Future
   research directions aimed at better understanding students emotional and
   behavioral responses to learning analytics feedback on dashboards and
   alerts are outlined.},

Abstract = {The learning analytics dashboard (LAD) has been recognised as a useful
   tool to facilitate teachers' diagnosis and intervention in collaborative
   learning. However, little empirical evidence has been reported
   concerning the effects of LAD on teachers in computer-supported
   collaborative learning (CSCL). The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the effectiveness of a LAD system called the Knowledge-Behavior-Social
   Dashboard (KBSD) for supporting teachers' diagnosis and intervention of
   CSCL activities. Thirty-five pre-service teachers participated in the
   experiment. The results indicated that teachers using KBSD used more
   `cross-group' strategies to diagnose students' learning problems.
   Teachers in the experimental group also performed more interventions
   involving `cognitive guidance', `scaffold instructing', `positive
   evaluation' and `individual facilitating'. Moreover, the analysis of the
   interview revealed that the KBSD tool has the potential to assist
   teachers in detecting learning problems in a group in an easy and
   convenient manner. Pedagogical implications and future research are also
   addressed.},

   compared to the rest of the class. This paper presents research work
   conducted at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), Sri
   Lanka, to solve the above problems and facilitate students learning in
   fully online and blended learning environments using Learning Analytics.
   The research objective is to design and create a Technology Enhanced
   Learning Analytics (TELA) dashboard for improving students' motivation,
   engagement, and grades. The Design Science research strategy was
   followed to achieve the objectives of the research. Initially, a
   literature survey was conducted analyzing features and limitations in
   current Learning Analytic dashboards. Then, current Learning Analytic
   plugins for Moodle were studied to identify their drawbacks. Two surveys
   with 136 undergraduate students and interviews with 12 lecturers were
   conducted to determine required features of the TELA system. The system
   was designed as a Moodle Plugin. Finally, an evaluation of the system
   was done with third-year undergraduate students of the UCSC. The results
   showed that the TELA dashboard can improve students' motivation,
   engagement, and grades. As a result of the system, students could track
   their current progress and performance compared to the peers, which
   helps to improve their motivation to engage more in the course. Also,
   the increased engagement in the course enhances the student's
   self-confidence since the student can see continuous improvement of
   his/her progress and performance which in turn improves the student's
   grades.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards are important tools that help professors
   to follow and understand students behavior inside Learning Management
   Systems. Moodle is one of the most popular and used Learning Management
   Systems available nowadays, and a number of initiatives have been
   conducted to offer Learning Analytics features inside it. The present
   paper describes MAD2, a Learning Analytics Dashboard developed for
   Moodle that offers different visualizations about students interactions
   inside the environment, and that uses machine learning techniques to
   early predict students at-risk of failure. The paper describes the
   predictive approach implemented inside the tool together with the most
   important visualization features available to the users. The offering of
   a tool to early predict students at-risk of failure inside Moodle is an
   important step to help professors and managers to better assist students
   during their courses.},

Title = {A Visual Dashboard to Track Learning Analytics for Educational Cloud
   Computing},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) stand out as useful
   platforms to teach distributed computing concepts as well as the
   development of Cloud-native scalable application architectures on
   real-world infrastructures. Instructors can benefit from high-level
   tools to track the progress of students during their learning paths on
   the Cloud, and this information can be disclosed via educational
   dashboards for students to understand their progress through the
   practical activities. To this aim, this paper introduces
   CloudTrail-Tracker, an open-source platform to obtain enhanced usage
   analytics from a shared AWS account. The tool provides the instructor
   with a visual dashboard that depicts the aggregated usage of resources
   by all the students during a certain time frame and the specific use of
   AWS for a specific student. To facilitate self-regulation of students,
   the dashboard also depicts the percentage of progress for each lab
   session and the pending actions by the student. The dashboard has been
   integrated in four Cloud subjects that use different learning
   methodologies (from face-to-face to online learning) and the students
   positively highlight the usefulness of the tool for Cloud instruction in
   AWS. This automated procurement of evidences of student activity on the
   Cloud results in close to real-time learning analytics useful both for
   semi-automated assessment and student self-awareness of their own
   training progress.},

Title = {Promoting higher education students' self-regulated learning through

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Learning analytics provides a novel means to support the development and
   growth of students into self-regulated learners, but little is known
   about student perspectives on its utilization. To address this gap, the
   present study proposed the following research question: what are the
   perceptions of higher education students on the utilization of a
   learning analytics dashboard to promote self-regulated learning? More
   specifically, this can be expressed via the following threefold
   sub-question: how do higher education students perceive the use of a
   learning analytics dashboard and its development as promoting the (1)
   forethought, (2) performance, and (3) reflection phase processes of
   self-regulated learning? Data for the study were collected from students
   (N = 16) through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using a
   qualitative content analysis. Results indicated that the students
   perceived the use of the learning analytics dashboard as an opportunity
   for versatile learning support, providing them with a means to control
   and observe their studies and learning, while facilitating various
   performance phase processes. Insights from the analytics data could also
   be used in targeting the students' development areas as well as in
   reflecting on their studies and learning, both individually and jointly
   with their educators, thus contributing to the activities of forethought
   and reflection phases. However, in order for the learning analytics
   dashboard to serve students more profoundly across myriad studies, its
   further development was deemed necessary. The findings of this
   investigation emphasize the need to integrate the use and development of
   learning analytics into versatile learning processes and mechanisms of
   comprehensive support and guidance.},

Title = {The role of reference frames in learners' internal feedback generation
   with a learning analytics dashboard},
Journal = {STUDIES IN EDUCATIONAL EVALUATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {79},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Being able to self-regulate can positively impact learners' academic
   achievement. An inherent catalyst of Self Regulated Learning (SRL) is
   internal feedback, the new knowledge which is generated when comparing
   current knowledge against reference information. Learners may not always
   generate internal feedback, hampering further SRL. Supporting SRL can be
   done with a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD), in which reference
   frames allow for comparisons and facilitate internal feedback
   generation. This study explores internal feedback generation using a LAD
   and the effect of reference frame availability. A multiple method design
   examined the interplay of reference frames, comparison processes,
   internal feedback generation and preparatory activities engagement.
   Differences between three conditions were explored using Bain
   ANOVA's.Results showed that reference frames almost exclude other
   external comparators and are used in parallel with an internal
   comparator. A peer reference frame leads to most verbalizations of
   internal feedback, and potentially to most verbalizations of preparatory
   activities.},

Title = {Self-regulation and emotion matter: A case study of instructor
   interactions with a learning analytics dashboard},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {161},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is providing new methodologies that are being
   applied to the design and application of dashboards to support teaching
   and learning. However, few studies attempt to understand how instructors
   interact with an LA dashboard and how self-regulated learning (SRL)
   activities and emotions of instructors occur and co-occur in the
   interaction. The current study investigates ten instructors' SRL
   activities and epistemic emotions by analyzing the screen capture videos
   and think-aloud data while they interact with an LA dashboard designed
   to support the online asynchronous collaboration of multiple groups. The
   results reveal that instructors demonstrated two ways of navigating LA
   dashboards, and they relied heavily on the conversation explorer
   feature. Instructors were mostly engaged in elaboration, monitoring, and
   evaluation activities and they frequently experienced confusion and
   enjoyment. Expert instructors were more likely to refer to their
   personal teaching experience and demonstrated more epistemic emotions
   than novice instructors. This study contributes to the literature on SRL
   and teacher emotions by revealing the critical role of elaboration,
   monitoring, evaluation, and epistemic emotions when instructors attempt
   to understand a LA dashboard by themselves. These findings highlight the
   importance of providing pedagogical assistance to teachers who are
   trying to navigate between group dynamics and visualizations viewed
   using LA dashboards.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the design of a learning analytics dashboard,
   utilizing learning traces that emerge from conversational MOOC
   activities. These chat-based activities encourage students to
   collaborate in dyads, with the support of a conversational agent, in
   order to answer open-ended questions, set by the course instructor.
   Taking into account the dynamic and context-sensitive nature of the
   agent-based support provided during this kind of online activities, we
   aspire to share a series of variables, metrics and use cases, which can
   be valuable for practitioners and researchers looking forward to
   initiate the development of a learning analytics dashboard that
   encompasses aspects of both peer-to-peer and human-to-bot conversational
   interactions.},

Title = {CADA: a teacher-facing learning analytics dashboard to foster teachers'

Abstract = {Despite the potential of learning analytics (LA) to support teachers'
   everyday practice, its adoption has not been fully embraced due to the
   limited involvement of teachers as co-designers of LA systems and
   interventions. This is the focus of the study described in this paper.
   Following a design-based research (DBR) approach and guided by concepts
   from the socio-cultural perspective and human-computer interaction
   (HCI), we design, test, and evaluate a teacher-facing LA dashboard, the
   Canvas Discussion Analytics Dashboard (CADA), in real educational
   settings. The goal of this dashboard is to support teachers' roles in
   online environments through insights into students' participation and
   discourse patterns. We evaluate CADA through 10 in-depth interviews with
   university teachers to examine their experiences using CADA in seven
   blended undergraduate and graduate courses over a one-year period. The
   findings suggest that engaging teachers throughout the analytics tool
   design process and giving them control/agency over LA tools can favour
   their adoption in practice. Additionally, the alignment of dashboard
   metrics with relevant theoretical constructs allows teachers to monitor
   the learning designs and make course design changes on the fly. The
   teachers in this study emphasise the need for LA dashboards to provide
   actionable insights by moving beyond what things are towards how things
   should be. This study has several contributions. First, we make an
   artefact contribution (e.g. CADA), an LA dashboard to support teachers
   with insights into students' online discussions. Second, by leveraging
   theory, and working with the teachers to develop and implement a
   dashboard in authentic teaching environments, we make an empirical,
   theoretical and methodological contribution to the field of learning
   analytics and technology enhanced learning. We synthesise these through
   practical design and implementation considerations for researchers,
   dashboard developers, and higher education institutions.},

Abstract = {A learning analytics dashboard enables teachers and students to monitor
   and reflect on their online teaching and learning patterns. This study
   was a review of prior studies on learning analytics dashboards to show
   the need to develop an instrument for measuring dashboard success. An
   early version of the instrument based on the framework of Kirkpatrick's
   four levels of evaluation was revised through expert reviews and
   exploratory factor analysis. The instrument contains five criteria:
   visual attraction, usability, level of understanding, perceived
   usefulness, and behavioral changes. The validity of the instrument was
   subsequently tested with factor analysis. A total of 271 samples from
   students who utilized a learning analytics dashboard for one semester
   were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling. In the
   model with fair fit, the visual attraction and usability of the
   dashboard significantly affected the level of understanding, and level
   of understanding affected perceived usefulness, which in turn
   significantly affected potential behavior changes. The findings of this
   study have implications for designers who want to develop successful
   learning analytics dashboards, and further research is suggested related
   to measuring the cross validity of the evaluation instrument to broaden
   its usage.},

Abstract = {Various efforts to scaffold improving reading performance and skills
   have been investigated, yet there have been no efforts to visualize the
   active reading (AR) process using logs, verify the effects on learning
   behavior and performance, and further deepen reading comprehension in a
   data-driven manner. To this end, an Active Reading Dashboard (AR-D) was
   specifically designed to visualize students' reading behavior, such as
   annotations and artifacts created during AR. The dashboard provides
   individual feedback, allowing students to reflect on the information
   from the whole class. Such approaches are difficult when conducting AR
   with paper-based materials. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in
   high school English classes to examine the differences in the effects of
   including AR-D reflections (experimental group: AR-D) and only following
   the AR process (control group: AR). The results indicated that AR-D
   promoted participants' learning behaviors during AR. However, regarding
   students' vocabulary acquisition and reading comprehension performance,
   both groups increased in the post-test without any significant
   difference from the AR-D group. Our findings suggest that using the
   dashboard during the English AR activity promoted desired student
   behaviors in attempting answers in English. The visualized data in AR-D
   can be a scaffold to decide on the next step toward improvement, which
   is one of the main objectives of integrating Learning Analytics (LA) in
   practice. We discuss how the LA dashboard can be used in a learning
   environment as effective means for learners and teachers.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) has been opening new opportunities to support
   learning in higher education (HE). LA dashboards are an important tool
   in providing students with insights into their learning progress, and
   predictions, leading to reflection and adaptation of learning plans and
   habits. Based on a human-centered approach, we present a perspective of
   students, as essential stakeholders, on LA dashboards. We describe a
   longitudinal study, based on survey methodology. The study included two
   iterations of a survey, conducted with second-year ICT students in 2017
   (N = 222) and 2022 (N = 196). The study provided insights into the LA
   dashboard features the students find the most useful to support their
   learning. The students highly appreciated features related to short-term
   planning and organization of learning, while they were cautious about
   comparison and competition with other students, finding such features
   possibly demotivating. We compared the 2017 and 2022 results to
   establish possible changes in the students' perspectives with the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The students' awareness of the benefits of LA has
   increased, which may be related to the strong focus on online learning
   during the pandemic. Finally, a factor analysis yielded a dashboard
   model with five underlying factors: comparison, planning, predictions,
   extracurricular, and teachers.},

Abstract = {The skill to take part in and to contribute to debates is important for
   informal and formal learning. Especially when addressing highly complex
   issues, it can be difficult to support learners participating in
   effective group discussion, and to stay abreast of all the information
   collectively generated during the discussion. Technology can help with
   the engagement and sensemaking of such large debates, for example, it
   can monitor how healthy a debate is and provide indicators of
   participation's distribution. A special framework that aims at
   harnessing the intelligence of - small to very large - groups with the
   support of structured discourse and argumentation tools is Contested
   Collective Intelligence (CCI). CCI tools provide a rich source of
   semantic data that, if appropriately processed, can generate powerful
   analytics of the online discourse. This study presents a visualisation
   dashboard with several visual analytics that show important aspects of
   online debates that have been facilitated by CCI discussion tools. The
   dashboard was designed to improve sensemaking and participation in
   online debates and has been evaluated with two studies, a lab experiment
   and a field study in the context of two Higher Education institutes. The
   paper reports findings of a usability evaluation of the visualisation
   dashboard. The descriptive findings suggest that participants with
   little experience in using analytics visualisations were able to perform
   well on given tasks. This constitutes a promising result for the
   application of such visualisation technologies as discourse-centric
   learning analytics interfaces can help to support learners' engagement
   and sensemaking of complex online debates.},

Abstract = {Insights derived from classroom data can help teachers improve their
   practice and students' learning. However, a number of obstacles stand in
   the way of widespread adoption of data use. Teachers are often sceptical
   about the usefulness of data. Even when willing to work with data, they
   often do not have the relevant skills. Tools for analysis of learning
   data can, theoretically, aid teachers in data use, but often fall short
   of their potential as they are commonly designed without reference to
   educational theory and rarely consider end-user's needs. Keeping these
   challenges in mind, we designed a professional development program that
   aimed at, among other things, improving teachers' beliefs regarding data
   and their data literacy skills. After the training, we found that
   teachers had more positive attitudes regarding data. However, some data
   literacy skills proved quite difficult to learn. We present and analyse
   our intervention here and forward a proposal for improving the
   effectiveness of data use interventions by leveraging theory-based
   Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards as mediating tools that scaffold
   teachers' acquisition of new knowledge and skills during and beyond the
   intervention.},

   available from adaptive learning technology can provide learners with
   feedback that is personalized. However, at an individual level, learners
   often experience technological and pedagogical conflicts. Learners have
   more freedom to accept, ignore or reject the feedback while also having
   the challenges of building learning strategies and utilizing learning
   information that requires self-regulated learning skills. Given the
   conflicts, both understanding how learners learn and providing support
   for learners to be more self-regulated in the learning environment are
   imperative. This investigation explores how learners processed their
   learning in an adaptive technology-integrated learning analytics
   dashboard (ALAD). It employed mixed-methods using a lens of
   self-regulated learning (SRL). Three groups were identified based on
   clustering analysis of the learners' usage of warm-up (WU) tests.
   Sequence analysis revealed the time trends of each group's interactions
   with course content. Reflexive thematic analysis brought insights on how
   learners built their learning strategies (eg, ways of using WU tests and
   submodule assessments) and how they monitored and controlled their
   learning. It showed their dynamic interactions with core adaptive
   learning analytics dashboard elements. Challenges such as difficulties
   in rehearsing and monitoring through segmented course content arose from
   the new structural changes. We suggest the need of future improvement to
   individual learning support through the learning analytics dashboard to
   be more diverse and dynamic (real-time) over the course of learning
   while reducing potential undesirable consequences. Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic One purpose of learning analytics
   and adaptive learning is to help learners identify learning goals and
   take action to achieve their goals. Learning analytics intervention
   showed support in learners' reflection phase SRL. However, it is not
   clear how to better support actionable and strategic changes to
   learning. Learning improvement through learning analytics interventions
   varies depending on how learners utilize feedback and monitor their
   learning progress, interacting with their digital learning environments.
   What this paper adds Learners established certain learning strategies
   with core adaptive learning analytics dashboard elements (eg, use of
   assessments, monitoring strategies). Learners' perceptions about
   learning support from the ALAD were built by interacting with the
   learners' task and cognitive conditions. Based on the perceptions,
   individuals' various SRL strategies and the need for diverse support
   were found. Monitoring and rehearsals can be challenging when course
   content is broken down for individuals' support. Implications for
   practice and/or policy Courses with adaptive learning analytics
   dashboards need to be designed more carefully, considering possible
   undesirable consequences, and to improve SRL support. Learners need more
   diverse learning support at an individual level based on how they
   interact with the learning environment.},

Abstract = {Educational technologies are being used more and more in secondary
   school settings. This increases the amount of students' learning related
   data produced and stored. To keep up with this rise and to get most out
   of the collected data, teachers need digital tools that support and
   facilitate their pedagogical decision-making process. Learning analytics
   dashboards can be a good source to provide teachers with necessary
   insights into their students' learning processes. However, for such
   tools to be effective and actionable, they have to be aligned with
   teachers' needs and thus, provide and visualize data in a concise and
   structured way. We therefore conducted a survey study with 11 English
   teachers from K-12 secondary schools in Germany who evaluated the
   assumed usefulness of possible dashboard features. Based on these
   findings, we developed a teacher dashboard incorporating the most
   desired functionalities, such as a quickly accessible summary of
   strengths, weaknesses and support needs, or an overview of current
   misconceptions and competencies alongside additional metrics in order to
   support multiple teaching practices. The implementation and the
   underlying calculations are described, focusing on the importance of
   learners' process data to provide teachers with a detailed and revealing
   view on their students' and class learning states. In an evaluation
   study of the dashboard's prototype with mock data, teachers (n=6) gave
   high ratings for the dashboard's usability.},

Abstract = {The ability to work collaboratively in intercultural virtual teams, is
   constantly gaining importance for the labour market. Virtual Mobility
   enables students to acquire the necessary intercultural teamwork skills
   while remaining locally integrated into their regular studies. But
   still, international virtual collaborative learning scenarios demand
   much time and effort for planning and coordination which binds
   resources. The support concepts for such collaborative virtual learning
   groups are also resource-intensive, because learners should be
   accompanied by qualified e-tutors to optimise learning results both at
   individual and group level. Classical summative tests and exams are
   rather unsuitable for the assessment of collaboration as expected
   learning outcome. These arrangements also need new formative assessment
   forms, as participants need active and ongoing feedback. A meaningful
   assessment of learning processes and outcomes should not only be based
   on the observation of `soft' factors but should also be complemented by
   `hard', fixed, automatically measurable, quantitative indicators. To
   gain these hard indicators the research project ISLA - Indicator-based
   Social Learning Analytics was launched. This paper presents the
   procedure for implementation as well as virtual presence, content
   creation and relationships within the community as first derived
   indicators and their prototypical visualisation in a Learning Analytics
   Dashboard.},

Title = {LADA: A learning analytics dashboard for academic advising},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {107},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {From the perspective of Learning and Educational Technologies, academic
   advising has been one of the most overlooked aspects of academic support
   systems, despite being critical for the learning process and final
   success of students. The majority of higher education institutions
   provides simple technical support to academic advisers with basic
   descriptive statistics. This article presents the general design and
   implementation of a Learning Analytics Dashboard for Advisers (LADA), to
   support the decision-making process of academic advisers through
   comparative and predictive analysis. Moreover, this work evaluates the
   use of this tool to support decision-making of actual advisers in two
   different higher education institutions (University A, University B),
   compared with more traditional procedures and tools. Results indicate
   that LADA enables expert advisers to evaluate significantly more
   scenarios (Median = 2), especially for high advising difficulty cases
   with students that failed many courses (Median(A) = 3, Median(B) = 2.5),
   in a not-significantly different amount of time. For inexperienced
   advisers, LADA is perceived as a valuable tool for more accurate and
   efficient decision-making, as they were able to make informed decisions
   in a similar amount of time compared to the experts. These results are
   encouraging for further developments in the field.},

Abstract = {Digitalization catalyzes drastic changes to a particular subject or
   area. Digitalization is an operational structure transformation process,
   such as in the educational domain. Digitalization in the academic field
   has brought the classroom to the users' fingertips with the prevalence
   of elearning applications, learning management systems, etc. However,
   with the increasing number of digital learning platform users, educators
   find it hard to monitor their students' progress. Analytics that analyze
   data generated from the usage pattern of the users contribute to giving
   the educators an insight regarding the performance of their students.
   With that, they can apply early intervention and modification of their
   delivery method to suit the students' needs and, at the same time,
   increase the quality of the content. This study illustrates the
   development of a learning analytics dashboard that can improve learning
   outcomes for educators and students.},

Title = {Student-Facing Learning Analytics Dashboard for Remote Lab Practical
   Work},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1037-1050},
Abstract = {The designs of many student-facing learning analytics (SFLA) dashboards
   are insufficiently informed by educational research and lack rigorous
   evaluation in authentic learning contexts, including during remote
   laboratory practical work. In this article, we present and evaluate an
   SFLA dashboard designed using the principles of formative assessment to
   provide feedback to students during remote lab activities. Feedback is
   based upon graphical visualizations of student actions performed during
   lab tasks and comparison to expected procedures using TaskCompare-our
   custom, asymmetric graph dissimilarity measure that distinguishes
   students who miss expected actions from those who perform additional
   actions, a capability missing in existing graph distance (symmetrical
   dissimilarity) measures. Using a total of N = 235 student graphs
   collected during authentic learning in two different engineering
   courses, we describe the validation of TaskCompare and evaluate the
   impact of the SFLA dashboard on task completion during remote lab
   activities. In addition, we use components of the motivated strategies
   for learning questionnaire as covariates for propensity score matching
   to account for potential bias in self-selection of use of the dashboard.
   We find that those students who used the SFLA dashboard achieved
   significantly better task completion rate (nearly double) than those who
   did not, with a significant difference in TaskCompare score between the
   two groups (Mann-Whitney U = 453.5, p < 0.01 and Cliff's delta = 0.43,
   large effect size). This difference remains after accounting for
   self-selection. We also report that students' positive rating of the
   usefulness of the SFLA dashboard for completing lab work is
   significantly above a neutral response (S = 21.0 and p < 0.01). These
   findings provide evidence that our SFLA dashboard is an effective means
   of providing formative assessment during remote laboratory activities.},

   learning context and aims to contribute insights into LAD design by
   using an academic approach in a practice-based environment. An existing
   storytelling LAD created to support 81 accountants was evaluated using
   Technology Acceptance Model, finding a learner expectation for clarity,
   conciseness, understanding and guidance on next steps. High usage levels
   and a `take what you need' approach was identified, with all
   visualizations and automated personalized feedback being considered
   useful although to varying degrees. Professional learners in this study
   focus on understanding and acting upon weaknesses rather than
   celebrating strengths. The lessons for LAD design are to offer choice
   and create elements which support learners to take action to improve
   performance at a multitude of time points and levels of success.},

Abstract = {The collection of programming session data is a cornerstone of
   programming learning analytics research. For text-based programming,
   there are data collection projects, like BlueJ's Blackbox, which provide
   access to the data and thereby facilitate additional research as well as
   verification. For block-based programming, only data sets of finished
   projects but not of programming sessions are available. We introduce a
   data repository that is extendable by implementing instrumentation
   plugins for various IDEs. The currently supported features are: data
   collection of text-based and block-based programming sessions, curated
   user self-registration and filtered data download. This then enables us
   to implement an educator dashboard in the future, making use of live
   programming session data to incorporate educators and students into
   learning analytics research.},

Abstract = {In Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) classrooms it may be
   challenging for teachers to keep awareness of certain aspects of the
   learning process of each small group or assess whether the enactment of
   the class script deviates from the original plan. Orchestration tools,
   aimed at supporting the management of the increasing uncertainty and
   complexity of CSCL classrooms, have been emerging in response.
   Similarly, learning analytics innovations hold the promise of empowering
   teachers by making certain aspects of the classroom visible and by
   providing information that can prompt actionable responses. However, the
   active role that data may play in teachers' decision-making and
   orchestration processes is still not well understood. This paper
   investigates the perspectives of teachers who used a real-time analytics
   tool to support the orchestration of a CSCL classroom. A longitudinal
   study was conducted with a handheld dashboard deployed in a
   multi-display collaborative classroom during one full academic term. The
   dashboard showed real-time information about group participation and
   task progress; the current state of the CSCL script; and a set of text
   notifications informing teachers of potential students' misconceptions
   automatically detected. The study involved four teachers conducting 72
   classroom sessions during 10 weeks with a total of 150 students. The
   teachers' perspectives discussed in this paper portray the promises and
   challenges of introducing new technologies aimed at enhancing
   orchestration and awareness in a CSCL classroom.},

Abstract = {Online learning can be challenging to learners as they need to have
   autonomous learning skills to succeed, and to instructors as direct
   observation and real-time communication with learners are limited.
   Learning analytics dashboards have been used to assist the learners in
   developing autonomous learning skills and the instructors in keeping
   track of the learners' progress. However, there is little information on
   systems supporting both learners and instructors in online learning
   environments. This paper builds on our previous work developing
   learners' metacognitive skills through open response prompts by using
   the learner inputs to create a dashboard that uncovers implicit feedback
   such as sentiments, misconceptions, and shallow learning. The instructor
   can consult the dashboard on-demand, and the input is from metacognitive
   prompts that only the individual learners see. Hence, the instructor can
   provide timely interventions based on inputs from learners who otherwise
   would not voice their concerns in more public channels such as
   discussion forums.},

Abstract = {Early warning dashboards in higher education analyze student data to
   enable early identification of underperforming students, allowing timely
   interventions by faculty and staff. To understand perceptions regarding
   the ethics and impact of such learning analytics applications, we
   conducted a multi-stakeholder analysis of an early-warning dashboard
   deployed at the University of Michigan through semi-structured
   interviews with the system's developers, academic advisors (the primary
   users), and students. We identify multiple tensions among and within the
   stakeholder groups, especially with regard to awareness, understanding,
   access and use of the system. Furthermore, ambiguity in data provenance
   and data quality result in differing levels of reliance and concerns
   about the system among academic advisors and students. While students
   see the system's benefits, they argue for more involvement, control, and
   informed consent regarding the use of student data. We discuss our
   findings' implications for the ethical design and deployment of learning
   analytics applications in higher education.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are often used to display real-time
   data indicating student learning trajectories and outcomes. Successful
   use of LADs requires teachers to orient their dashboard reviews with
   clear goals, apply appropriate strategies to interpret visualized
   information on LADs and monitor and evaluate their interpretations to
   meet goals. This process is known as self-regulated learning (SRL).
   Critical as it is, little research investigates teachers' SRL in LAD
   usage. The present study addressed the gap by examining teachers' SRL
   and sought to understand how teachers' SRL relates to their use of LADs.
   To this end, a case study was designed in which ten participants were
   invited to use a LAD for asynchronous online problem-based learning.
   Think-aloud techniques and process mining methods were applied. The
   findings show that teachers were cognitive regulation in the early stage
   of LAD usage and became more metacognitive regulated later. The
   comparison of SRL between the good and the weak regulators indicates
   that the good self-regulators enacted more monitoring and evaluation
   events. Thus their regulator pattern was more non-linear. The
   qualitative analysis of think-aloud protocols reveals that teachers with
   good SRL are more likely to use the LAD to diagnose issues in student
   learning and collaboration. The study highlights the importance of SRL
   for teachers' success in using LAD for data-driven instructions. The
   study also reinforces the importance of fostering teachers' SRL, which
   accounts for teachers' professional success in the digital era.},

Title = {Applying Kano's two-factor theory to prioritize learning analytics

Journal = {CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Existing methods for software requirements elicitation, five-point
   Likert scales and voting methods for requirements prioritization, and
   usability and user experience evaluation methods do not enable
   prioritizing the learning analytics dashboard requirements. Inspired by
   management and product design field, this research applies Kano's
   two-factor theory to prioritize the features of learning analytics
   dashboards (LADs) of adaptive learning platform (ALP) called RhapsodeTM
   TM learner, based on students' perceived usefulness to support
   designers' decision-making. Comparing usability and user experience
   methods for evaluating LAD features, this paper contributes with the
   protocol and a case applying Kano method for evaluating the perceived
   importance of the dashboards in ALP. The paper applies Kano's two-factor
   questionnaire on the 13 LADs features of RhapsodeTM TM learner.
   Responses from 17 students are collected using a questionnaire, which is
   used to showcase the strength of the two-factor theory through five
   tabular and graphical techniques. Through these five tabular and
   graphical techniques, we demonstrate the application and usefulness of
   the method as designers and management are often carried away by the
   possibilities of insights instead of actual usefulness. The results
   revealed a variation in the categorization of LADs depending on the
   technique employed. As the complexity of the techniques increases,
   additional factors that indicate data uncertainty are gradually
   incorporated, clearly highlighting the growing requirement for data. In
   the case of RhapsodeTM learner platform, results based on the students
   responses show that 11 of 13 LADs being excluded due to low significance
   level in categorization (technique 1) and low response rate.},

Abstract = {In recent years, virtual learning environments, laptops, tablets and
   mobile devices have been introduced in the classroom. These technologies
   start a snowball effect: the old tools teachers used to fathom the
   students' learning progress, since so much happens online, are not
   enough. Thus, the need for new tools to analyse the students' activity
   on the online learning environments arises. The field of learning
   analytics can provide some of these tools. In this paper, we introduce
   the Student's Progress Snapshot (SPS), a Learning Analytics Dashboard
   that allows teachers to analyse the activity of their students on Moodle
   courses. The SPS running as software as a service, includes both charts
   and automatically generated explanatory texts of these charts. During
   the academic course 2015-2016 a pilot was conducted to validate the SPS.},

Abstract = {Big data has changed the approach in designing an e-Learning. When
   students interact with e-Learning content, automatically generating
   data, we can collect and trace their learning tracks. The data is
   processed and analyzed, then used to understand the behavioral
   characteristics of the user or student to enable a personalized learning
   experience. In this study, learning analytics dashboard was used to
   improve learning interaction which impacts the learning successfulness.
   Tests were conducted on 67 students in the Educational Technology
   Department of the State University of Malang and distributed
   questionnaires and then analyzed using descriptive methods. The result
   is that most of the students who take online learning using the learning
   analytics dashboard find it helpful to carry out self-evaluations of
   their interaction hence they can manage their learning. The results of
   the study showed that most participants agreed that LAD could provide
   information to them regarding their interactions with learning content
   (M = 4.15, SD = 0.557), learning environment (M = 4.13, SD = 0.457), as
   well as the participants could conduct problem identification during
   their learning process (M = 3.88, SD = 0.477).},

Abstract = {Many universities choose the C programming language (C) as the first one
   they teach their students, early on in their program. However, students
   often consider programming courses difficult, and these courses often
   have among the highest dropout rates of computer science courses
   offered. It is therefore critical to provide more effective instruction
   to help students understand the syntax of C and prevent them losing
   interest in programming. In addition, homework and paper-based exams are
   still the main assessment methods in the majority of classrooms. It is
   difficult for teachers to grasp students' learning situation due to the
   large amount of evaluation work. To facilitate teaching and learning of
   C, in this article we propose a system-LAPLE (Learning Analytics in
   Programming Language Education)-that provides a learning dashboard to
   capture the behavior of students in the classroom and identify the
   different difficulties faced by different students looking at different
   knowledge. With LAPLE, teachers may better grasp students' learning
   situation in real time and better improve educational materials using
   analysis results. For their part, novice undergraduate programmers may
   use LAPLE to locate syntax errors in C and get recommendations from
   educational materials on how to fix them.},

Title = {A Real-Time Learning Analytics Dashboard for Automatic Detection of
   Online Learners' Affective States},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {APR 24},
Abstract = {Students' affective states describe their engagement, concentration,
   attitude, motivation, happiness, sadness, frustration, off-task
   behavior, and confusion level in learning. In online learning, students'
   affective states are determinative of the learning quality. However,
   measuring various affective states and what influences them is
   exceedingly challenging for the lecturer without having real interaction
   with the students. Existing studies primarily use self-reported data to
   understand students' affective states, while this paper presents a novel
   learning analytics system called MOEMO (Motion and Emotion) that could
   measure online learners' affective states of engagement and
   concentration using emotion data. Therefore, the novelty of this
   research is to visualize online learners' affective states on lecturers'
   screens in real-time using an automated emotion detection process. In
   real-time and offline, the system extracts emotion data by analyzing
   facial features from the lecture videos captured by the typical built-in
   web camera of a laptop computer. The system determines online learners'
   five types of engagement ({''}strong engagement{''}, ``high
   engagement{''}, ``medium engagement{''}, ``low engagement{''}, and
   ``disengagement{''}) and two types of concentration levels
   ({''}focused{''} and ``distracted{''}). Furthermore, the dashboard is
   designed to provide insight into students' emotional states, the
   clusters of engaged and disengaged students', assistance with
   intervention, create an after-class summary report, and configure the
   automation parameters to adapt to the study environment.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Volume = {163},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Despite the potential of learning analytics for personalized learning,
   it is seldom used to support collaborative learning particularly in
   face-to-face (F2F) learning contexts. This study uses learning analytics
   to develop a dashboard system that provides adaptive support for F2F
   collaborative argumentation (FCA). This study developed two dashboards
   for students and instructors, which enabled students to monitor their
   FCA process through adaptive feedback and helped the instructor provide
   adaptive support at the right time. The effectiveness of the dashboards
   was examined in a university class with 88 students (56 females, 32
   males) for 4 weeks. The dashboards significantly improved the FCA
   process and outcomes, encouraging students to actively participate in
   FCA and create high-quality arguments. Students had a positive attitude
   toward the dashboard and perceived it as useful and easy to use. These
   findings indicate the usefulness of learning analytics dashboards in
   improving collaborative learning through adaptive feedback and support.
   Suggestions are provided on how to design dashboards for adaptive
   support in F2F learning contexts using learning analytics.},

Abstract = {With the help of learning analytics, MOOCs have wider potential to
   succeed in learning through promoting self-regulated learning (SRL). The
   current study aims to apply and validate visualization design guidelines
   for a MOOC dashboard to enhance such SRL capabilities based on learning
   analytics. To achieve the research objective, a MOOC dashboard
   prototype, LM-Dashboard, was designed and developed, reflecting the
   visualization design guidelines to promote SRL. Then, both expert and
   learner participants evaluated LM-Dashboard through iterations to
   validate the visualization design guidelines and perceived SRL
   effectiveness. The results of expert and learner evaluations indicated
   that most of the visualization design guidelines on LM-Dashboard were
   valid and some perceived SRL aspects such as monitoring a student's
   learning progress and assessing their achievements with time management
   were beneficial. However, some features on LM-Dashboard should be
   improved to enhance SRL aspects related to achieving their learning
   goals with persistence. The findings suggest that it is necessary to
   offer appropriate feedback or tips as well as to visualize learner
   behaviors and activities in an intuitive and efficient way for the
   successful cycle of SRL. Consequently, this study contributes to
   establishing a basis for the visual design of a MOOC dashboard for
   optimizing each learner's SRL.},

Abstract = {Although learning analytics (LA) dashboard visualizations are
   increasingly being used to provide feedback to students, literature on
   the effectiveness of LA dashboards has been inconclusive. To address
   this, a LA student dashboard visualizing students' latest data against
   their own data from previous weeks (i.e., self-referenced data) was
   designed informed by Fredrickson's (2004) broaden-and-build theory, as
   well as studies highlighting personal best goals (Martin \& Elliot,
   2016) and the negative effects of peer comparisons (Corrin \& de Barba,
   2014). The self-referenced LA student dashboard was implemented and
   evaluated in a Singapore Secondary school as part of a larger study,
   WiREAD. This paper reports on the quantitative impact of the WiREAD
   self-referenced LA dashboard visualizations on 15-year-old students'
   critical reading fluency, cognitive reading engagement, and English
   language (EL) self-efficacy, as well as students' qualitative feedback
   on the usefulness and shortcomings of the LA dashboard.},

Title = {Learning analytics dashboard design: Workplace learner preferences for
   reference frames in immersive training in practice},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {2840-2855},

Abstract = {BackgroundLearning analytics dashboards are increasingly being used to
   communicate feedback to learners. However, little is known about learner
   preferences for dashboard designs and how they differ depending on the
   self-regulated learning (SRL) phases the dashboards are presented (i.e.,
   forethought, performance, and self-reflection phases) and SRL skills.
   Insight into design preferences for dashboards with different reference
   frames (i.e., progress, social, internal achievement and external
   achievement) is important because the effectiveness of feedback can
   depend upon how a learner perceives it.ObjectiveThis study examines
   workplace learner preferences for four dashboard designs for each SRL
   phase and how SRL skills relate to these preferences.MethodsSeventy
   participants enrolled in a chemical process apprenticeship program took
   part in the study. Preferences were determined using a method of
   adaptive comparative judgement and SRL skills were measured using a
   questionnaire. Preferences were tested on four dashboard designs
   informed by social and temporal comparison theory and goal setting
   theory. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine the
   relationship between dashboard preferences and SRL.Results and
   ConclusionsResults show that the progress reference frame is more
   preferred before and after task performance, and the social reference
   frame is less preferred before and after task performance. It was found
   that the higher the SRL skill score the higher the probability a learner
   preferred the progress reference frame compared to having no preference
   before task performance. The results are consistent with other findings,
   which suggest caution when using social comparison in designing
   dashboards which provide feedback.
   What is already known about this topic? Learning analytics dashboards
   use visualisations to provide feedback on learning tasks to optimise
   learning. Learners can better understand the meaning of their feedback
   if it is presented alongside a point of comparison, such as a prior
   level of performance, the performance level of their peers or how their
   performance level compares to an achievement goal. Learning analytics
   dashboards can support learning behaviours before, during, and after
   learners perform a task. Learners can acquire information to improve
   their learning via learning analytics dashboards, such as feedback on
   performance, which illustrates areas of a task learners are stronger and
   weaker at, which in turn can help inform future training efforts.What
   this paper adds? Workplace learners typically prefer dashboards which
   offer visualisations comparing their current performance level with past
   levels of performance. Comparison with peers is typically the least
   preferred point of comparison when offered in learning analytics
   dashboards. No clear preference emerged between reference frames
   containing assigned or self-set goals in dashboards presented before and
   after task performance.Implications for practice Designers should take
   into account learner preferences when designing learning analytics
   dashboard visualisations. Designers should consider presenting learning
   analytics dashboards before, during, and after task performance.
   Designers should gain more insight into how learners process learning
   analytic dashboards and act upon it.},

Abstract = {This study investigates current approaches to learning analytics (LA)
   dashboarding while highlighting challenges faced by education providers
   in their operationalization. We analyze recent dashboards for their
   ability to provide actionable insights which promote informed responses
   by learners in making adjustments to their learning habits. Our study
   finds that most LA dashboards merely employ surface-level descriptive
   analytics, while only few go beyond and use predictive analytics. In
   response to the identified gaps in recently published dashboards, we
   propose a state-of-the-art dashboard that not only leverages descriptive
   analytics components, but also integrates machine learning in a way that
   enables both predictive and prescriptive analytics. We demonstrate how
   emerging analytics tools can be used in order to enable learners to
   adequately interpret the predictive model behavior, and more
   specifically to understand how a predictive model arrives at a given
   prediction. We highlight how these capabilities build trust and satisfy
   emerging regulatory requirements surrounding predictive analytics.
   Additionally, we show how data-driven prescriptive analytics can be
   deployed within dashboards in order to provide concrete advice to the
   learners, and thereby increase the likelihood of triggering behavioral
   changes. Our proposed dashboard is the first of its kind in terms of
   breadth of analytics that it integrates, and is currently deployed for
   trials at a higher education institution.},

Abstract = {More and more learning in higher education settings is being facilitated
   through online learning environments. Students' ability to self-regulate
   their learning is considered a key factor for success in higher
   education. Learning analytics offer a promising approach to better
   support and understand students' learning processes. The purpose of this
   study is to investigate students' expectations towards features of
   learning analytics systems and their willingness to use these features
   for learning. A total of 20 university students participated in an
   initial qualitative exploratory study. They were interviewed about their
   expectations of learning analytics features. The findings of the
   qualitative study were complemented by a quantitative study with 216
   participating students. The findings show that students expect learning
   analytics features to support their planning and organization of
   learning processes, provide self assessments, deliver adaptive
   recommendations, and produce personalized analyses of their learning
   activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboard (LAD) development has been criticized for
   being too data-driven and for developers lacking an understanding of the
   nontechnical aspects of learning analytics (LA). The ability of
   developers to address their understanding of learners as well as
   systematic efforts to involve students in the development process are
   central to creating pedagogically grounded student-facing dashboards.
   However, limited research is available about developer perceptions on
   supporting students with LA. We examined an interdisciplinary LA
   development team's (IDT) perceptions of and intentions to support
   student agency, and the student-facing LAD development process.
   Qualitative content analysis supported by a social cognitive theory
   framework was conducted on interviews (N = 12) to analyze the IDT's
   perceptions of student agency. IDT members had differing conceptions of
   student agency but agreed that it manifests in strategic study
   progression and planning, as well as in active interpretation and use of
   LA-based feedback. IDT members had differing views on student
   involvement in the LAD development process. Communication challenges
   within an IDT and limited resources were mentioned, impeding development
   work. The results of this study highlight the importance of fostering
   communication among IDT members about guiding pedagogical design
   principles and the systematic use of educational concepts in LA
   development processes.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) simplify complex learner data into
   accessible visualisations, providing actionable insights for educators
   and students. However, their educational effectiveness has not always
   matched the sophistication of the technology behind them. Explanatory
   and interactive LADs, enhanced by generative AI (GenAI) chatbots, hold
   promise by enabling dynamic, dialogue-based interactions with data
   visualisations and offering personalised feedback through text. Yet, the
   effectiveness of these tools may be limited by learners' varying levels
   of GenAI literacy, a factor that remains underexplored in current
   research. This study investigates the role of GenAI literacy in learner
   interactions with conventional (reactive) versus scaffolding (proactive)
   chatbot-assisted LADs. Through a comparative analysis of 81
   participants, we examine how GenAI literacy is associated with learners'
   ability to interpret complex visualisations and their cognitive
   processes during interactions with chatbot-assisted LADs. Results show
   that while both chatbots significantly improved learner comprehension,
   those with higher GenAI literacy benefited the most, particularly with
   conventional chatbots, demonstrating diverse prompting strategies.
   Findings highlight the importance of considering learners' GenAI
   literacy when integrating GenAI chatbots in LADs and educational
   technologies. Incorporating scaffolding techniques within GenAI chatbots
   can be an effective strategy, offering a more guided experience that
   reduces reliance on learners' GenAI literacy.},

Title = {Learning analytics dashboard-based self-regulated learning approach for
   enhancing students' e-book-based blended learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},

Abstract = {Blended learning (BL) combines traditional classroom activities with
   online learning resources, enabling students to obtain higher academic
   performance through well-defined interactive learning strategies.
   However, lacking the capacity to self-regulate their learning, many
   students might fail to comprehensively study the learning materials
   after face-to-face learning. In this study, a learning analytics
   dashboard (LAD)-based self-regulated learning (SRL) approach is proposed
   to enhance the students' practices of SRL in an e-book-based BL
   environment. The proposed approach aims to support students to precisely
   reflect on their face-to-face e-book reading activities, effectively
   review the e-book learning materials after the face-to-face learning
   sessions, and, finally, set new goals for their next face-to-face
   learning session by using a LAD. To evaluate the effects of the proposed
   approach, a quasi-experimental design was deployed in a university-level
   course that adopted a BL model. The experimental group learned through
   the proposed approach using an e-book and the LAD, whereas the control
   group learned using the conventional BL approach using only the e-book.
   The results of the one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and
   Mann-Whitney U test demonstrate a statistically significant difference
   (p-value less than 0.01) between both groups in terms of students'
   learning outcomes, awareness of SRL, self-efficacy (SE), and e-book
   reading engagements. This provides educators with evidence of the
   effectiveness of an explicit SRL approach in BL, which not only improves
   student learning outcomes from the given course and awareness of
   self-regulation and SE but also increases course engagement compared to
   students who learn with conventional BL approaches.},

Abstract = {To successfully implement a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD), the
   perceived usability by its users' needs to be assessed at different
   stages of development. This study examines how the demographic
   background of students in maritime education and training, their
   academic experiences, and perception toward artificial intelligence
   (AI), data security etc. influences the perceived usability of a LAD
   prototype. Two LAD visualizations under development have been shared
   with two groups of potential users: (1) line graphs based on desktop
   simulator log data, and (2) heat maps based on eye-tracking data. A
   follow up survey was conducted incorporating the System Usability Scale
   (SUS) and focusing on related qualitative factors. A total of 63 useable
   responses were analysed using machine learning (ML). The findings reveal
   that users who were exposed to line graphs have a higher perceived
   usability than those exposed to eye-tracking heat maps. Further, those
   with a higher degree of trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) also have
   a higher perceived system usability.},

Abstract = {While the field of Learning Analytics is in full development, potential
   users are just discovering the opportunities offered by these tools. One
   of the major difficulties consists in proposing a visual data

   to identify user needs in terms of visualization, and to define the main
   dimensions of a learning dashboard, we propose a tool to support
   participatory design. This tool is based on a canvas and cards to help
   dashboards' creation using Learning Analytics. It allows users to
   support creativity around decision making, characterize their context,
   and draw a dashboard's mockup using existing content.},

Title = {Responsive Dashboard as a Component of Learning Analytics System for
   Evaluation in Emergency Remote Teaching Situations},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The pandemic crisis has forced the development of teaching and
   evaluation activities exclusively online. In this context, the emergency
   remote teaching (ERT) process, which raised a multitude of problems for
   institutions, teachers, and students, led the authors to consider it
   important to design a model for evaluating teaching and evaluation
   processes. The study objective presented in this paper was to develop a
   model for the evaluation system called the learning analytics and
   evaluation model (LAEM). We also validated a software instrument we
   designed called the EvalMathI system, which is to be used in the
   evaluation system and was developed and tested during the pandemic. The
   optimization of the evaluation process was accomplished by including and
   integrating the dashboard model in a responsive panel. With the
   dashboard from EvalMathI, six online courses were monitored in the
   2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic years, and for each of the six
   monitored courses, the evaluation of the curricula was performed through
   the analyzed parameters by highlighting the percentage achieved by each
   course on various components, such as content, adaptability, skills, and
   involvement. In addition, after collecting the data through interview
   guides, the authors were able to determine the extent to which online
   education during the COVID 19 pandemic has influenced the educational
   process. Through the developed model, the authors also found software
   tools to solve some of the problems raised by teaching and evaluation in
   the ERT environment.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics can bridge the gap between learning sciences and data
   analytics, leveraging the expertise of both fields in exploring the vast
   amount of data generated in online learning environments. A typical
   learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a
   visualisation tool built with the purpose of empowering teachers and
   learners to make informed decisions about the learning process. Related
   work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the
   theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of
   such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the
   extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been
   integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at
   learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take
   into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical
   foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting
   that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising
   information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived
   positively by all learners. We summarise the insights gathered through
   our literature review in a set of recommendations for the design and
   evaluation of learning analytics dashboards for learners.},

Abstract = {The aim of student-facing dashboards is to support learning by providing
   students with actionable information and promoting self-regulated
   learning. We created a new dashboard design aligned with SRL theory,
   called MyLA, to better understand how students use a learning analytics
   tool. We conducted sequence analysis on students' interactions with
   three different visualizations in the dashboard, implemented in a LMS,
   for a large number of students (860) in ten courses representing
   different disciplines. To evaluate different students' experiences with
   the dashboard, we computed chi-squared tests of independence on
   dashboard users (52\%) to find frequent patterns that discriminate
   students by their differences in academic achievement and self-regulated
   learning behaviors. The results revealed discriminating patterns in
   dashboard use among different levels of academic achievement and
   self-regulated learning, particularly for low achieving students and
   high self-regulated learners. Our findings highlight the importance of
   differences in students' experience with a student-facing dashboard, and
   emphasize that one size does not fit all in the design of learning
   analytics tools.},

Abstract = {Research has shown the effectiveness of designing a Learning Analytics
   Dashboard (LAD) for learners and instructors, including everyone's
   levels of progress and performance. An intertwined relationship exists
   between learning analytics (LA) and the learning process. Understanding
   information or data about learners and their learning journey can
   contribute to a deeper understanding of learners and the learning
   process. The design of an effective learning dashboard relies heavily on
   LA, including assessment of the learning process, i.e., gains and
   losses. A Learning Loss Recovery Dashboard (LLRD) can be designed as an
   instructional tool, to support the learning process as well as learners'
   performance and their academic achievement. The current project proposes
   a LLRD prototype model to deal with potential learning loss; increase
   the achievement of learning outcomes; and provide a single,
   comprehensive learning process, where schools can evaluate and remedy
   any potential learning loss resulting from the distance-learning period
   that was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic dashboard
   prototype functions to determine learning gains by K-12 learners. It is
   expected that the implementation of the proposed dashboard would provide
   students, teachers, and educational administrators with an integrated
   portal, for a holistic and unified remedial experience for addressing
   learning loss.},

Abstract = {This paper elaborates the design of a National Learning Analytics (LA)
   and Educational Data Mining System for pre-tertiary education in
   Croatia. The described approach consists of the following five phases:
   1) objectives setting, 2) user needs analysis, 3) data availability
   analysis, 4) dashboards pre-design and 5) validation of functionalities.
   There is an evident research gap, as well as the lack of practical
   examples about the development of a Learning Analytics System (LAS) for
   pre-tertiary education on the national and/or regional level. Therefore,
   this research aims to make a scientific contribution by filling the
   recognized gap, but also contribute to solving the practical issues of
   national schools' LAS development. To increase the usability of an LAS,
   the involvement of all end users is essential. In the described case,
   six main user groups were identified: 10-18 years old students,
   teachers, school management and support staff, regional and national
   authorities responsible for education, strategic bodies and researchers
   and, finally, project partners that work on system development. For each
   of them, separate dashboard functionalities have been designed through
   several rounds of consultations. Consultations with users started with
   focus groups and panels, to brainstorm the most important issues they
   would like to answer in order to enhance learning and teaching. Between
   the two rounds of consultation, there was an evaluation phase of the
   relevance of the gathered questions. Finally, targeted users provided
   feedback on the pre-production functionalities of each dashboard and
   validated them. In this process, several challenges were detected,
   including data gathering and protection, ethical issues and
   interpretation of results for students who are underage, and continuous
   adjustments to the users' needs.},

Abstract = {Gamification is one of the most used techniques to improve active
   participation and engagement in different kinds of contexts. The use of
   game techniques is effective in pushing subjects to be involved in an
   activity. Since the early childhood, indeed, the promises of rewards are
   useful to affect specific behaviors. On the other hands, the learning
   analytics have been largely implemented in education in order to improve
   the assessment and the self-assessment of students, above all in
   e-learning settings. The research presented in this work aims at
   combining gamification techniques and learning analytics to improve the
   engagement in University courses. The paper describes a model of
   gamification and a learning dashboard defined based on data in Moodle
   e-learning platform. A pilot test of an app android in which both the
   solutions have been implemented pointed out promising results.},

   progress in the learning management systems, their predicted chance of
   passing, their predicted grade and their online intermediate performance
   compared with the total cohort. The email with dashboard access, as well
   as dashboard use, has positive effects on student behaviour in the
   online environment, but no effects are found on student performance in
   the final exam of the programming course. However, we do find
   differential effects by specialisation and student characteristics.},

Abstract = {The value that data has in the information society is undeniable.
   However data per se has limited significance, as it requires structure
   and it needs to be adequately conveyed to the user. Education is no
   exception to all the sectors currently harnessing the power of the data
   that stems from the interaction with their various stakeholders.
   Learning analytics can assist educators to understand how their students
   are learning, how successful they are at the accomplishment of certain
   tasks and to identify if they are at risk of failing. A fundamental part
   of learning analytics is visualisation, which is responsible for the
   communication of the data that is collected and becomes central in
   determining the teacher intervention in the learning process. In this
   paper the authors will present the results of semi-structured interviews
   that were conducted with lecturers at UNIV faculties and schools, in
   order to collect their insights regarding what aspects should be
   considered when design a teachers dashboard. Main requirements as well
   as major concerns are compiled and discussed. This is specifically
   useful to guide the future design of a teacher dashboard at UNIV and
   other universities.},

Abstract = {As social media takes root in our society, more University instructors
   are incorporating platforms like Twitter into their classroom. However,
   few of the current Learning Analytics (LA) systems process social media
   data for instructional interventions and evaluation. As a result,
   instructors who are using social media cannot easily assess their
   students' learning progress or use the data to adjust their lessons in
   real time. We surveyed 54 university instructors to better understand
   how they use social media in the classroom; we then used these results
   to design and evaluate our own Twitter-centric LA dashboard. The
   overarching goals for this project were to 1) assist instructors in
   determining whether their particular use of Twitter met their teaching
   objectives, and 2) help system designers navigate the nuance of
   designing LA dashboards for social media platforms.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) can provide learners with insights
   about their study progress through visualisations of the learner and
   learning data. Despite their potential usefulness to support learning,
   very few studies on LADs have considered learners' needs and have
   engaged learners in the process of design and evaluation. Aligning with
   that, there is a limited understanding of what specific student cohorts,
   in particular distance and online learners, may seek from LADs to
   effectively support their studies. In this study, we present findings
   from 21 interviews with undergraduate distance learners, mainly high
   performers, that aimed to capture student perceptions about the
   usefulness of specific LAD features and the factors that explain these
   perceptions. Our findings revealed that amongst the LAD features
   favoured by students was the potential to receive study recommendations,
   whereas comparison with peers was amongst the least favoured elements,
   unless informed by qualitative information. Factors including
   information trust, attitudes, age, performance and academic
   self-confidence were found to explain these perceptions.},

Abstract = {It is claimed that the innovative use of educational technology combined
   with appropriate pedagogical strategies can lead to improved student
   outcomes. However, teachers face difficulties in adopting educational
   technology and novel pedagogical methods as this involves acquiring

   dashboards - artifacts which mediate teachers' learning in
   technology-enhanced environments - can aid them in this task. Using
   student engagement as an example, we present the prototype of a
   theory-driven dashboard that can help teachers to better understand and
   implement new instructional methods in technology-enhanced learning
   environments. We describe here our needs analysis, design, and
   evaluation process and outcomes, reflecting upon how teachers can
   benefit from using thoughtfully-designed LA dashboards in professional

   a co-design approach involving focus groups and interviews, students
   identified desired features like comprehensive resource overviews,
   deadline tracking, progress highlights, and enhanced interactions with
   peers and instructors. The final dashboard design allows learners to
   assess and track their knowledge, progress, and upcoming tasks, with
   metrics that facilitate comparisons against their goals and provide
   adaptive feedback. A user study (N=177) confirmed that users are engaged
   with the dashboard, but the planning and reflection tools were used less
   than the monitoring tools.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},

Pages = {794-802},
Abstract = {Educational dashboards enable students to monitor and reflect on
   academic performance and administrative aspects of the learning
   processes. Occasionally, educational institutions integrate dashboards
   using the information found in their learning management systems or
   their students' information desks. Learning analytics offers ways to
   enrich these dashboards and expose students to analyzed information
   beyond the monitored data provided such as smart recommendations.
   Despite the large variety of dashboards, the students' centric
   perspective and the ability to adapt the dashboard to their personal
   needs is not a common practice. To identify and support the needs of
   students who wish to track aspects of their learning routine, it is very
   important to position the students at the core of the design process of
   these dashboards. This article presents a new phase in our research to
   expand our understanding of the students' needs in monitoring their
   educational routines and preferences while using an advanced form of a
   learning analytics dashboard. We propose an optimized approach for
   designing educational dashboards. In this sense, we examine and seek to
   integrate the components that are prominently required by students.
   Hence, we address both the type of components as well as their
   arrangement within the customized dashboard. The outcomes of our efforts
   reveal findings concerning students' trends and habits when exploiting
   these dashboards. It also offers pivotal insights and recommendations
   for the optimized implementation of learning analytics dashboards that
   are aligned with the students' authentic requirements.},

Abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) refers to small group collaborative
   learning situations where students solve complex problems with the
   assistance of teachers who serve as facilitators. Scaling PBL using
   technology requires specific tools since online asynchronous PBL can
   increase the number of small groups that engage in the curriculum but
   poses challenges to PBL teachers who must attend to multiple groups. To
   address the problem, we have been researching how technology can be used
   to develop specific tools to extend expert teachers' instructional
   capacities. Building on previous work, we present the most recent design
   of a pedagogical dashboard used in an online asynchronous PBL
   environment. We illustrate how the new pedagogical dashboard
   visualizations can support PBL instructors observing individual student
   learning activities, diagnosing group dynamics and intervening when
   necessary.},

Abstract = {Based on the achievement goal theory, this experimental study explored
   the influence of predictive and descriptive learning analytics
   dashboards on graduate students' motivation and statistics anxiety in an
   online graduate-level statistics course. Participants were randomly
   assigned into one of three groups: (a) predictive dashboard, (b)
   descriptive dashboard, or (c) control (i.e., no dashboard). Measures of
   motivation and statistical anxiety were collected in the beginning and
   the end of the semester via the Motivated Strategies for Learning
   Questionnaire and Statistical Anxiety Rating Scale. Individual
   semi-structured interviews were used to understand learners' perceptions
   of the course and whether the use of the dashboards influenced the
   meaning of their learning experiences. Results indicate that, compared
   to the control group, the predictive dashboard significantly reduced
   learners' interpretation anxiety and had an effect on intrinsic goal
   orientation that depended on learners' lower or higher initial levels of
   intrinsic goal orientation. In comparison to the control group, both
   predictive and descriptive dashboards reduced worth of anxiety (negative
   attitudes towards statistics) for learners who started the course with
   higher levels of worth anxiety. Thematic analysis revealed that learners
   who adopted a more performance-avoidance goal orientation approach
   demonstrated higher levels of anxiety regardless of the dashboard used.},

Abstract = {We have designed, developed, and implemented a student-facing learning
   analytics dashboard in order to support students as they learn in online
   environments. There are two separate dashboards in our system: a content
   recommender dashboard and a skills recommender dashboard. The content
   recommender helps students identify gaps in their content knowledge; the
   skills recommender helps students improve their metacognitive
   strategies. We discuss the technical requirements needed to develop a
   real-time student dashboard as well as report our inquiry into the
   functionality students want in a dashboard. The dashboards were
   evaluated with focus groups and a perceptions survey. Students were
   positive in their perceptions of the dashboards and 79\% of the students
   that used the dashboards found them user-friendly, engaging, useful, and
   informative. One challenge encountered was low student use of the
   dashboard. Only 25\% of students used the dashboard multiple times,
   despite favorable student perceptions of the dashboard. Additional
   research should examine how to motivate and support students to engage
   with dashboard feedback in online environments.},

Abstract = {Educational outcomes from traditionally underrepresented groups are
   generally worse than for their more advantaged peers. This problem is
   typically known as the awarding gap (we use the term awarding gap over
   `attainment gap' as attainment places the responsibility on students to
   attain at equal levels) and continues to pose a challenge for
   educational systems across the world. While Learning Analytics (LA)
   dashboards help identify patterns contributing to the awarding gap, they
   often lack stakeholder involvement, offering very little support to
   institutional Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) leads or educators
   to pinpoint and address these gaps. This paper introduces an innovative
   EDI LA dashboard, co-created with diverse stakeholders. Rigorously
   evaluated, the dashboard provides fine-grained insights and course-level
   analysis, empowering institutions to effectively address awarding gaps
   and contribute to a diverse and inclusive higher education
   landscape.Practitioners notes What is already known about this topic
   Traditionally underrepresented groups face educational disparities,
   commonly known as the awarding gap. Underachievement is a complex
   multi-dimensional problem and cannot be solely attributable to
   individual student deficiencies. LA dashboards targeting this specific
   problem are often not public, there is little research about them, and
   are frequently designed with little involvement of educational
   stakeholders. What this paper adds Pioneers the introduction of a
   dashboard specifically designed to address the awarding gap problem.
   Emphasises the significant data needs of educational stakeholders in
   tackling awarding gaps. Expands the design dimensions of Learning
   Analytics (LA) by introducing a specific design approach rooted in
   established user experience (UX) design methods. Implications for
   practice and/or policy Insights from this study will guide
   practitioners, designers, and developers in creating AI-based
   educational systems to effectively target the awarding gap problem.},

Title = {A Customizable and Incremental Processing Approach for Learning
   Analytics},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {36350-36362},
Abstract = {The ability of learning analytics to improve the learning/teaching
   processes is widely recognized. In this paper, the learning analytics
   architecture developed at the Digital Content Production Center of the
   Technical University of Cartagena (Spain) is presented. This
   architecture contributes to the field of learning analytics in two
   aspects: it allows for dashboard customization and improves the
   efficiency of the analysis of learners interaction data. Events
   resulting from learners interaction are captured and stored in Caliper
   standard format, to be further processed incrementally to allow
   dashboards to be shown without delay to teachers. Customization is
   considered a mandatory requirement for learning analytics tools,
   however, although some proposals have recently been made, a greater
   research effort in this topic is necessary. In the present work, this
   requirement is addressed by defining a domain-specific language (DSL)
   that allows teachers to customize dashboards. This language allows to
   express indicators (logical expressions) that classify students into
   different groups depending on their performance level. The paper also
   shows how our learning analytics approach was evaluated with a course
   that applies a flipped classroom method, and how it compares to the most
   relevant related works that have been published.},

Title = {Team interactions with learning analytics dashboards},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {185},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Student-facing visualisations have attracted increased attention with
   recent developments in data-driven tools to support individual and group
   work. Learning analytics dashboards (LADs), a data-enhanced feedback
   tool that allows students to make sense of their learning by providing
   insights into their learning behaviours represents one of the prominent
   examples of this trend. While these visualisation tools are increasingly
   used to study and enhance students' learning in academic contexts,
   current research is limited regarding the effects of the LADs in K-12
   environments. There is a missed opportunity to empower teams and allow
   instructors and researchers to understand how teams use the LAD to
   regulate their learning. In this study, we developed a K12 LAD for
   supporting students' collaborative work and evaluated with respect to
   students' perceived usefulness of the proposed LAD and the association
   between its use and course performance. The study followed a
   mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of log data from
   the dashboard and qualitative analysis of students' perceptions using
   surveys and focus groups. Our results show that different roles within
   teams have distinguished engagement patterns with the LAD and that the
   tool improves the collaborative learning experience. We postulate that
   the implications of this study will aid future research work when
   investigating the behaviours of teams and optimising their learning
   using LADs.},

Abstract = {With the exponential growth of educational data, increasing attention
   has been given to student learning supported by learning analytics
   dashboards. Related research has indicated that dashboards relying on
   descriptive analytics are deficient compared to more advanced analytics.
   However, there is a lack of empirical data to demonstrate the
   performance and differences between different types of analytics in
   dashboards. To investigate these, the study used a controlled,
   between-groups experimental method to compare the effects of descriptive
   and prescriptive dashboards on learning outcomes. Based on the learning
   analytics results, the descriptive dashboard describes the learning
   state and the prescriptive dashboard provides suggestions for learning
   paths. The results show that both descriptive and prescriptive
   dashboards can effectively promote students' cognitive development. The
   advantage of prescriptive dashboard over descriptive dashboard is its
   promotion in learners' learning strategies. In addition, learners' prior
   knowledge and learning strategies determine the extent of the impact of
   dashboard feedback on learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Remote technology has been widely incorporated into health professions
   education. For procedural skills training, effective feedback and
   reflection processes are required. Consequently, supporting a
   self-regulated learning (SRL) approach with learning analytics
   dashboards (LADs) has proven beneficial in online environments. Despite
   the potential of LADs, understanding their design to enhance SRL and
   provide useful feedback remains a significant challenge. Focusing on LAD
   design, implementation, and evaluation, the study followed a
   mixed-methods twophase design-based research approach. The study used a
   triangulation methodology of qualitative interviews and SRL and
   sensemaking questionnaires to comprehensively understand the LAD's
   effectiveness and student SRL and feedback uptake strategies during
   remote procedural skills training. Initial findings revealed the value
   students placed on performance visualization and peer comparison despite
   some challenges in LAD design and usability. The study also identified
   the prominent adoption of SRL strategies such as help-seeking,
   elaboration, and strategic planning. Sensemaking results showed the
   value of personalized performance metrics and planning resources in the
   LAD and recommendations to improve reflection and feedback uptake.
   Subsequent findings suggested that SRL levels significantly predicted
   the levels of sensemaking. The students valued the LAD as a tool for
   supporting feedback uptake and strategic planning, demonstrating the
   potential for enhancing procedural skills learning.},

Abstract = {The purposes of the two studies reported in this research are to adapt
   and validate the instrument of the Evaluation Framework for Learning
   Analytics (EFLA) for learners into the Turkish context, and to examine
   how metacognitive and behavioral factors predict learner performance.
   Study 1 was conducted with 83 online learners enrolled in a 16-week
   course delivered through the Moodle learning management system. The
   findings from the confirmatory factor analysis indicated that a
   three-factor model of the EFLA for learners provided the best model fit
   for the collected data. The model is consistent with the factorial
   structure of the original instrument developed based on the data from
   the European learners. Study 2 aimed to reveal how the metacognitive and
   behavioral factors pertaining to the learning analytics dashboard
   predict learners' academic performance. A total of 63 online learners
   enrolled in a 14-week online computing course participated in this
   study. The results from the logistic regression analysis indicated that
   online learners more frequently interacted with the learning analytics
   dashboard demonstrated greater academic performance. Furthermore, the
   dimensions of the EFLA, together with the interaction with the
   dashboard, significantly predicted learners' academic performance. This
   multiple-study investigation contributes to the generalizability of the
   EFLA for learners and highlights the importance of metacognitive and
   behavioral factors for the impact of learning analytics dashboards on
   learner performance.},

Abstract = {Assessment is a crucial aspect of any teaching and learning process.
   Educational games offer promising advantages for assessment;
   personalised feedback to students and automated assessment process.
   However, while many teachers agree that educational games increase
   motivation, learning and retention, few of them are ready to fully trust
   them as an assessment tool. We believe there are two main reasons for
   this lack of trust: educators are not given sufficient information about
   the gameplays, and many educational games are distributed as
   black-boxes, unmodifiable by teachers. This paper presents an assessment
   engine designed to separate a game and its assessment. It allows
   teachers to modify a game's assessment after distribution and visualise
   gameplay data via a learning analytics dashboard. The engine was
   evaluated quantitatively by 31 educators. Findings were overall very
   positive: both the assessment editor and the learning analytics
   dashboard were rated useful and easy to use. The evaluation also
   indicates that, having access to EngAGe, educators would be more likely
   to trust a game's assessment. This paper concludes that EngAGe can be
   used by educators effectively to modify educational games' assessment
   and visualise gameplay data, and that it contributes to increasing their
   trust in educational games as an assessment tool.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards have become a popular medium for
   communicating to teachers analytical insights obtained from student
   data. However, recent research indicates that LA dashboards can be
   complex to interpret, are often not grounded in educational theory, and
   frequently provide little or no guidance on how to interpret them.
   Despite these acknowledged problems, few suggestions have been made as
   to how we might improve the visual design of LA tools to support richer
   and alternative ways to communicate student data insights. In this
   paper, we explore three design alternatives to represent student
   multimodal data insights by combining data visualisation, narratives and
   storytelling principles. Based on foundations in data storytelling,
   three visual-narrative interfaces were designed with teachers: i) visual
   data slices, ii) a tabular visualisation, and iii) a written report.
   These were validated as a part of an authentic study where teachers
   explored activity logs and physiological data from co-located
   collaborative learning classes in the context of healthcare education.
   Results suggest that alternatives to LA dashboards can be considered as
   effective tools to support teachers' reflection, and that LA designers
   should identify the representation type that best fits teachers' needs.},

Abstract = {In science and engineering education, remote laboratories are designed
   to bring ubiquity to experimental scenarios, by having real laboratories
   operated through the Internet. Despite that remote laboratories enable
   the collection of students' work data, the educational use of these data
   is still underdeveloped. Learning analytics dashboards are common tools
   to present and analyze educational data to provide indicators to
   understand learning processes. This paper presents how data from remote
   labs, such as Virtual Instruments Systems In Reality (VISIR), can be
   analyzed through a learning analytics dashboard to help instructors
   provide better feedback to their pupils. Visualizations to study the use
   of the VISIR, to assess students' performance in a particular activity
   and to facilitate the assisted assessment of students are introduced to
   the VISIR dashboard (VISIR-DB). These visualizations include a new
   recodification of circuits that keeps the fragment being measured, in
   order to better identify student's intention. VISIR-DB also incorporates
   functions to check a priori steps in the resolution process and/or
   potential errors (observation items), and logical combinations of them
   to grade students' performance according to the expected outcomes
   (assessment milestones). Both work indicators, observation items and
   assessment milestones, can be defined in activity-specific text files
   and allow for checking the circuit as coded by the interface, the
   conceptual circuit it represents, its components, parameters, and
   measurement result. Main results in the use of VISIR for learning DC
   circuits course show that students mainly use VISIR when indicated by
   instructors and a great variability regarding to time of use and number
   of experiments performed. For the particular assessment activity,
   VISIR-DB helps to easily detect that there is a significant number of
   students that did not achieved any of the expected tasks. Additionally,
   it helps to identify students that still make a huge number of errors at
   the end of the course. Appropriate interventions can be taken from here.},

Abstract = {In our current society the acquisition of competences such as teamwork
   is essential. However, the evaluation of how this competence is
   developed is not easy and requires methodologies and tools to support
   the assessment process. In this sense several Learning Analytics tools
   have been developed. They explore students' interactions in different
   types of tools such as forums or instant messaging apps. However those
   tools are especially focused on the quantitative evaluation of the
   interaction and are not very usable. This work presents a new dashboard
   that analyzes students' Telegram interactions while they work as a team
   to address a project. The innovation of this tool lies in the
   functionalities included to explore not only numbers about messages,
   replies, type of messages, characters, etc., but the content of the
   texts. To do so natural language processing and sentiment analysis
   libraries were used. The tool has been tested successfully with 4
   subject editions in which it is possible to appreciate an evolution in
   students' interactions.},

Abstract = {Technology has become an integral part of our everyday life, and its use
   in educational environments keeps growing. Additionally, video games are
   one of the most popular mediums across cultures and ages. There is ample
   evidence that supports the benefits of using games for learning and
   assessment, and educators are mainly supportive of using games in
   classrooms. However, we do not usually find educational games within the
   classroom activities. One of the main problems is that teachers report
   difficulties to actually know how their students are using the game so
   that they can analyze properly the effect of the activity and the
   interaction of students. To support teachers, educational games should
   incorporate learning analytics to transform data generated by students
   when playing useful information in a friendly and understandable way.
   For this work, we build upon Shadowspect, a 3D geometry puzzle game that
   has been used by teachers in a group of schools in the US. We use
   learning analytics techniques to generate a set of metrics implemented
   in a live dashboard that aims to facilitate that teachers can understand
   students' interaction with Shadowspect. We depict the multidisciplinary
   design process that we have followed to generate the metrics and the
   dashboard with great detail. Finally, we also provide uses cases that
   exemplify how teachers can use the dashboard to understand the global
   progress of their class and each of their students at an individual
   level, in order to intervene, adapt their classes and provide
   personalize feedback when appropriate.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how teachers use dashboards in primary school
   classrooms. While learners practice on a tablet real-time data
   indicating learner progress and performance is displayed on teacher
   dashboards. This study examines how teachers use the dashboards,
   applying Verberts' learning analytics process model. Teacher dashboard
   consultations and resulting pedagogical actions were observed in 38
   mathematics lessons. In stimulated recall interviews, the 38 teachers
   were asked to elaborate on how they reflect on and make sense of the
   information on the dashboard. The results showed that teachers consulted
   the dashboard on average 8.3 times per lesson. Teachers activated
   existing knowledge about students and the class to interpret dashboard
   information. Task and process feedback were the pedagogical actions most
   often used following dashboard consultation. Additionally, teachers who
   consulted the dashboard more often activated more and more diverse
   pedagogical knowledge to interpret the data and, consequently, gave more
   and more diverse feedback. These results indicated that teacher
   dashboards were indeed influencing teachers' pedagogical actions in
   their daily classroom activities. This study provided the first evidence
   that dashboards progressively impact teaching practice and initiate more
   profound behavioral changes as teachers become more proficient in using
   them.},

Abstract = {In recent years, instructional design has become even more challenging
   for teaching staff members in higher education institutions. If
   instructional design causes student overload, it could lead to
   superficial learning and decreased student well-being. A strategy to
   avoid overload is reflecting upon the effectiveness of teaching
   practices in terms of time-on-task. This article presents a
   Work-In-Progress conducted to provide teachers with a dashboard to
   visualize student self-reports of time-on-task regarding subject
   activities. A questionnaire was applied to 15 instructors during a set
   trial period to evaluate the perceived usability and usefulness of the
   dashboard. Preliminary findings reveal that the dashboard helped
   instructors became aware about the number of hours spent outside of
   class time. Furthermore, data visualizations of time-on-task evidence
   enabled them to redesign subject activities. Currently, the dashboard
   has been adopted by 106 engineering instructors. Future work involves
   the development of a framework to incorporate user-based improvements.},

Title = {Linking learning behavior analytics and learning science concepts:
   Designing a learning analytics dashboard for feedback to support
   learning regulation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {107},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Technological advancements have generated a strong interest in exploring
   learner behavior data through learning analytics to provide both learner
   and instructor with process-oriented feedback in the form of dashboards.
   However, little is known about the typology of dashboard feedback
   relevant for different learning goals, learners and teachers. While most
   dashboards and the feedback that they give are based only on learner
   performance indicators, research shows that effective feedback needs
   also to be grounded in the regulatory mechanisms underlying learning
   processes and an awareness of the learner's learning goals. The design
   artefact presented in this article uses a conceptual model that
   visualizes the relationships between dashboard design and the learning
   sciences to provide cognitive and behavioral process oriented feedback
   to learners and teachers to support regulation of learning. A practical
   case example is given that demonstrates how the ideas presented in the
   paper can be deployed in the context of a learning dashboard. The case
   example uses several analytics/visualization techniques based on
   empirical evidence from earlier research that successfully tested these
   techniques in various learning contexts. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Effective learning analytics dashboards (LADs) should offer both
   instructors and students valuable insights into student learning.
   Information about one's learning, as both a product and a process,
   should be provided to the user as actionable data visualizations and
   aggregated indicators of learning. However, most dashboards often solely
   focus on the instructor's perspective, neglecting the impact of
   providing students with their data in a student view. Furthermore, these
   dashboards assume instructors are proficient in data analytics and can
   quickly interpret complicated visualizations in-situ while accounting
   for context and conditional factors. This challenge is further
   exacerbated by the lack of theoretically informed learning analytics
   principles and design choices as many of the dashboards rely primarily
   on performance-based data, neglecting process and trace data of
   cognitive, metacognitive, affective, motivational, and social (CAMMS)
   processes. As such, we are introducing MetaDash, a multimodal
   self-regulated learning (SRL) dashboard with both an instructor and
   student view. This dual-view (i.e., instructor and student-facing)
   dashboard prototype is populated with aggregate and contextualized
   multimodal trace data grounded within models of SRL, affect dynamics,
   information processing, cognitive load, and multimodal learning
   analytics. In this paper, we leverage ideas derived from SRL to identify
   gaps in current learning analytics dashboards. We then present the
   design principles and architecture of MetaDash, including how we derived
   its structure and how it supports our framework. We discuss the
   affective dynamics and learning analytics on the landing page to
   understand user engagement and detail how analytics are customized for
   different phases within the architecture. We highlight the advantages of
   incorporating real-time data analysis for immediate decision-making.
   Future research will focus on refining MetaDash through enhancements
   informed by user and focus group testing, experimental studies, and the
   integration of user feedback to address challenges and expand the
   dashboard's functionality and effectiveness.},

Abstract = {This paper describes a Human-Centred Learning Analytics (HCLA) design
   approach for developing learning analytics (LA) dashboards for K-12
   classrooms that maintain both contextual relevance and scalability-two
   goals that are often in competition. Using mixed methods, we collected
   observational and interview data from teacher partners and assessment
   data from their students' engagement with the lesson materials. This
   DBR-based, human-centred design process resulted in a dashboard that
   supported teachers in addressing their students' learning needs. To
   develop the dashboard features that could support teachers, we found
   that a design refinement process that drew on the insights of teachers
   with varying teaching experience, philosophies and teaching contexts
   strengthened the resulting outcome. The versatile nature of the
   approach, in terms of student learning outcomes, makes it useful for
   HCLA design efforts across diverse K-12 educational contexts.},

Abstract = {The educational community continuously seeks ways to improve the
   learner-centered learning process through new approaches like Learning
   analytics and its dashboard, which is helpful to enhance the teaching
   and the learning process. It involves a process whose final goal is
   presenting results to support decision-making about improving the
   learning process. However, a descriptive Learning analytics interface
   for analyzing learning data of students, including the disadvantaged,
   where to view and interpret learners' historical data is -in general-
   missing in this research domain. Hence, more research is still required
   to establish the philosophy of learning analytics on inclusion with an
   interface for the stakeholders to understand learning and teaching in an
   inclusive learning environment. This paper fills this gap by providing
   an inclusive educational learning analytics dashboard to support
   teachers and students. This study aimed to present a learning analytics
   implementation in the context of a smart ecosystem for learning and
   inclusion. We gave the inclusive educational needs and discussed the
   workflow followed during the descriptive learning analytics dashboard
   development. Therefore, the study improved existing learning analytics
   dashboards with a descriptive approach and inclusiveness of students
   with disabilities. Owing to the software development nature of this
   study, agile methodology based on five stages was applied: requirement
   elicitation; data gathering; design and prototyping; implementation; and
   testing and integration. We performed an initial evaluation, which
   indicated that the dashboard is suitable for understanding teachers' and
   students' needs and expectations. Besides, the visualization of
   inclusive learning characteristics improves engagement and attainment of
   learning goals.},

Abstract = {Current Learning Analytics (LA) systems are primarily designed with
   University staff members as the target audience; very few are aimed at
   students, with almost none being developed with direct student
   involvement and undertaking a comprehensive evaluation. This paper
   describes a HEFCE funded project that has employed a variety of methods
   to engage students in the design, development and evaluation of a
   student facing LA dashboard. LA was integrated into the delivery of 4
   undergraduate modules with 169 student sign-ups. The design of the
   dashboard uses a novel approach of trying to understand the reasons why
   students want to study at university and maps their engagement and
   predicted outcomes to these motivations, with weekly personalised
   notifications and feedback. Students are also given the choice of how to
   visualise the data either via a chart-based view or to be represented as
   themselves. A mixed-methods evaluation has shown that students' feelings
   of dependability and trust of the underlying analytics and data is
   variable. However, students were mostly positive about the usability and
   interface design of the system and almost all students once signed-up
   did interact with their LA. The majority of students could see how the
   LA system could support their learning and said that it would influence
   their behaviour. In some cases, this has had a direct impact on their
   levels of engagement. The main contribution of this paper is the
   transparent documentation of a User Centred Design approach that has
   produced forms of LA representation, recommendation and interaction
   design that go beyond those used in current similar systems and have
   been shown to motivate students and impact their learning behaviour.},

Abstract = {The existing researches and developments of dashboard visualizing
   results from learning analytics mainly serve the instructors instead of
   learners in a direct manner. Effective visualizations extracted from
   learning log data can help the students to reflect and compare studying
   activities and access their metacognition to improve their
   self-regulated learning. For such purposes, we designed a reading path
   graph for visualizing the studying activities on slide pages used as
   teaching materials in classes intuitively, as one of the key functions
   of the learning dashboard. By providing the comparisons between the
   user's own situation and the class overview, the visualization is
   expected to motivate the further actions of using other tools of the
   learning dashboard and reflecting studies. This paper introduces our
   exploration of the data process flows of extracting necessary data from
   a large number of operational logs for the visualization, and the
   techniques and strategies applied for rendering the graphics
   effectively. We implemented the data processing module with Python3 and
   the web-based visualization module of the reading path graph with
   JavaScript based on D3.js considering the extensibilities. The issues
   engaged in the development of prototypes are discussed, which will lead
   to the improvement of future prototypes and better designs of user
   experiments for formative evaluations as the next step of this research.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach to build and deploy learning
   analytics dashboards in multiple learning environments. Existing
   learning dashboards are barely portable: once deployed on a learning
   platform, it requires considerable effort to deploy the dashboard
   elsewhere. We suggest constructing dashboards from lightweight web
   applications, namely widgets. Our approach allows to port dashboards
   with no additional cost between learning environments that implement
   open specifications (OpenSocial and ActivityStreams) for data access and
   use widget APIs. We propose to facilitate reuse by sharing the
   dashboards and widgets via a centralized analytics repository.},

Abstract = {Learning in the workplace is crucial in higher engineering education,
   since it allows students to transfer knowledge and skills from
   university to professional engineering practice. Learning analytics
   endeavors in higher education have primarily focused on classroom-based
   learning. Recently, workplace learning analytics has become an emergent
   research area, with target users being workers, students and trainers.
   We propose technology for workplace learning analytics that allows
   program managers of higher engineering education programs to get insight
   into the workplace learning of their students, while ensuring privacy of
   students' personal data by design. Using a design-based agile
   methodology, we designed and developed a customizable workplace learning
   dashboard. From the evaluation with program managers in the computing
   domain, we can conclude that such technology is feasible and promising.
   The proposed technology was designed to be generaliz able to other
   (engineering) domains. A next logical step would be to evaluate and
   improve the proposed technology within other engineering domains.},

Abstract = {The potential of Analytics and Data mining methodologies, that extract
   useful and actionable information from large data-sets, has transformed
   one field of scientific inquiry after another. Analytics has been widely
   applied in Business Organizations as Business Analytics and when applied
   to education, these methodologies are referred to as Learning Analytics
   and Educational Data mining. Learning Analytics proposes to collect,
   measure and analyze data in learning environments to improve teaching
   and learning process. Educational Data mining (EDM) thrives on existing
   data collected by learning management systems. The applicability of
   Learning Analytics and Educational Data mining can be extended to
   traditional learning processes by suitably combining data collected from
   technology enabled processes such as Admission and Assessment with data
   generated from analysis of learning interactions. The intellectual
   performance of the students can be analyzed using some well known
   Learning Frameworks. This paper demonstrates the Complete Analytics
   process from data collection, measurement to Analysis using Guilford's
   structure of intellect model. An analytic dashboard provides the
   necessary information in concise and visual form and in an interactive
   mode. The analytic process presented on talent examination data can be
   generalized to similar examinations in traditional educational setup.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are intended to give relevant
   information to students and other stakeholders to inform potential next
   steps in the learning process. The current study examines the
   relationship between information indirectly presented through academic
   advisors' use of LADs, and college students' academic motivation,
   self-regulated learning, and academic achievement. We modeled how
   changes in student motivation and self-regulated learning (SRL) were
   related to what occurred during 1-on-1 meetings with academic advisors
   during which students had the potential to view representations of their
   achievement embedded within an Early Warning System (EWS) that visually
   represented aspects of their academic performance referenced with course
   averages. Constructs associated with SRL were moderated by
   advisor-advisee meetings. Results indicated that advisors' use of EWS
   while they met with students was negatively associated with the rate of
   decrease of students' reporting of using memorizing strategies but
   positively related when students' performance was compared to that of
   their peers. We discuss the moderating effects of students' exposure to
   visualizations of academic performance on their SRL strategies and
   academic motivation. This study points to the importance of monitoring
   the effects of information presented via EWS on motivation and SRL.},

Abstract = {This paper presents four categories of learning analytics tools:
   dashboards, ad hoc tools, tools for analysis of specific issues, and
   learning analytics frameworks, and details the characteristics of a
   selection of tools within each category: (1) Moodle Dashboard and Moodle
   default reporting tool; (2) Interactions and Teamwork Assessment Tool;
   (3) SNAPP, GraphFES and Moodle Engagement Analytics; and (4) VeLA and
   GISMO. The study investigates how these tools can be applied to the
   analysis of courses by using real data from a course that made intensive
   use of forums, wikis, web resources, videos, quizzes and assignments.
   The discussion that follows points out how the different tools
   complement each other, and suggests the implementation of basic
   dashboards in learning platforms and the use of external frameworks for
   learning analytics.},

Title = {Adoption and impact of a learning analytics dashboard supporting the
   advisor-Student dialogue in a higher education institute in Latin

Abstract = {This paper presents a case study on the adoption and the impact of new
   modules in a learning analytics dashboard supporting the dialogue
   between student advisors and students when advising on a study plan for
   the next academic semester in Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral,
   a higher education institute in Ecuador. The impact and the adoption of
   the new dashboard modules were assessed using a mixed-methods approach.
   The quantitative approach builds on data of 172 advisors in 34 programs
   and 4481 advising sessions in 2019 (post) and 4747 advising sessions in
   2018 (pre) to assess the adoption and use of the dashboard, the level of
   support experienced by the advisors, the impact of the new dashboard
   modules on the difference between the advised study plan and the plan
   students register for, and students' academic achievement. The
   qualitative approach with observations of 14 staged advising dialogues
   and semi-structured interviews with eight advisors was used to assess
   how the dashboard was used and to get deeper understanding of the
   perceived usefulness and impact of the dashboard. The results show that
   an institution-wide deployment of dashboard modules tailored to the
   needs of the advisors can be achieved and can increase the level of
   support perceived by the advisors and significantly decrease the gap
   between the suggested study plans in advising dialogues and the study
   plans that students actually register for. On the short-term, however,
   no significant changes in academic achievement were observed.
   Practitioner Notes
   What is already known about this topic?
   Academic advising can positively impact retention, academic achievement
   and study completion.
   Learning analytics dashboards are promising pieces of educational
   technology for academic advising as they can trigger reflection and
   sense-making of educational data.
   Evaluation of learning analytics dashboards is often still immature and
   not well-connected to the actual goals of the dashboards. Large-scale
   evaluations looking at impact of dashboards are even scarcer.
   What this paper adds?
   This paper adds, to the scarce scientific evidence on academic advising
   dashboards, a large-scale case study on a dashboard supporting the
   advisor student dialogue during the composition of well-balanced study
   plans.
   The paper presents research evidence of the impact of the dashboard on
   the support advisors experience, the study plans suggested by the
   advisors and the ones actually registered by the students and students'
   academic achievement. Evidence is based on a quantitative analysis,
   using data of 172 advisors from 34 programs representing more than 9000
   advising dialogues, and a qualitative analysis using observations and
   interviews.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Dashboards to support academic advising dialogues can be realized
   institution-wide at scale. Training of student advisors supports a large
   scale deployment.
   Well-designed dashboards that focus on addressing needs of advisors
   increase the level of support that advisor experience when advising
   students.
   Dashboard accommodating the simulation of study plans and the workload
   associated with them, succeed in decreasing the variance in suggested
   plans between advisors and reduce the gap between the study plans that
   advisors suggest to student and the study plans that students actually
   register for. Short-term impact on academic achievement was not
   observed.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe substantial growth in gamification research has connected
   gamified learning to enhanced engagement, improved performance, and
   greater motivation. Similar to gamification, personalized learning
   analytics dashboards can enhance student engagement. ObjectivesThis
   study explores the student experiences and academic achievements using a
   gamified dashboard in a large, introductory STEM course. MethodsWe
   examined two groups of students enrolled in different sections of a
   one-semester-long physical geology course with a total enrollment of 223
   students. The only difference between the groups was that one had access
   to the dashboard. The data collection included students' assignments,
   overall performances, and exam scores. Students in both sections
   completed a Science Literacy Concept Inventory survey at the beginning
   and end of the term. Additionally, students completed an end-of-term
   survey containing open-ended questions on their experience and
   interactions with specific elements. ResultsStudents shared mostly
   positive comments about their experience with the dashboard, and the
   final grade of students with access to the dashboard was 13\% higher, on
   average, compared to their peers in the non-dashboard section.
   ConclusionWith low costs and little time invested, gamified dashboards
   could have a significant impact on student performance in large STEM
   lecture courses.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are becoming a key element in
   enabling learners to monitor their learning, plan and actually learn.
   However, LADs are sometimes not completely adapted to students, who are
   rarely involved in their design. Moreover, even when they are, the
   implemented LADs are often the same for all students, whereas previous
   works have shown the value of adapted LADs. Here we investigate which
   adaptations are requested by students, and attempt to identify which
   data and visualizations are suitable depending on the student's profile.
   More specifically, we consider dynamic profiles as students'
   expectations can vary over the course duration. By using LADs co-design
   sessions both online and on-site, we collected needs from N = 386
   university students from different disciplines and degree level, split
   in 108 groups (2 to 4 students). After a manual annotation, we
   identified a total of 54 types of data and indicators, divided into 12
   thematics. Our first analysis confirmed some previous results,
   particularly on the use of peer comparisons that do not fulfill every

Title = {Visual Learning Analytics for Educational Interventions in Primary and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Visual Learning Analytics (VLA) uses analytics to monitor and assess
   educational data by combining visual and automated analysis to provide
   educational explanations. Such tools could aid teachers in primary and
   secondary schools in making pedagogical decisions, however, the evidence
   of their effectiveness and benefits is still limited. With this scoping
   review, we provide a comprehensive overview of related research on
   proposed VLA methods, as well as identifying any gaps in the literature
   that could assist in describing new and helpful directions to the field.
   This review searched all relevant articles in five accessible databases
   - Scopus, Web of Science, ERIC, ACM, and IEEE Xplore - using 40
   keywords. These studies were mapped, categorized, and summarized based
   on their objectives, the collected data, the intervention approaches
   employed, and the results obtained. The results determined what
   affordances the VLA tools allowed, what kind of visualizations were used
   to inform teachers and students, and, more importantly, positive
   evidence of educational interventions. We conclude that there are
   moderate-to-clear learning improvements within the limit of the studies'
   interventions to support the use of VLA tools. More systematic research
   is needed to determine whether any learning gains are translated into
   long-term improvements.},

Abstract = {Several governments across the world have temporarily closed educational
   institutions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, numerous
   universities have seen a growing trend towards online learning
   scenarios. Thus, learning takes place not just within a person, but
   within and across the networks. However, the current implementations of
   open learning scenarios are facing many challenges, including: a) there
   is no systematic feature to track, evaluate and report the online
   learning activities of students; b) lack of immediacy and personal
   feedback; and c) lack of self-reflection. Consequently, Learning
   Analytics (LA) is one of the most distinguished solutions to address
   these challenges. In this study, the two kinds of LA dashboard,
   behavioral and cognitive, have been investigated. The methodological
   approach taken in this investigation was adopted from a design-based
   research framework, which blends empirical educational research with the
   theory-driven design of online learning environments. The initial sample
   consisted of 320 undergraduate nursing students. The cohort was divided
   into two groups according to the two types of LA dashboard. The findings
   have argued that behavioral dashboards took precedence over data
   evaluation items, while cognitive dashboards had the advantage in
   achieving the goals of LA - e.g., awareness, self-reflection, and impact
   on learning process.},

Abstract = {Background Small private online courses (SPOCs) are one of the
   strategies to introduce the massive open online courses (MOOCs) within
   the university environment and to have these courses validates for
   academic credit. However, numerous researchers have highlighted that
   academic dishonesty is greatly facilitated by the online context in
   which SPOCs are offered. And while numerous algorithms have already been
   proposed, no research has been performed on how to transfer this
   information to instructors, so that they can intervene and decrease the
   prevalence of this issue. Objectives In this article, we present a
   qualitative evaluation of a tool for detecting and monitoring students
   suspected of academic dishonesty in SPOCs in Selene, a Colombian
   instance of Open edX. Methods The evaluation was carried out through
   semi-structured interviews with four instructors who taught SPOCs with
   academic recognition at the University of Cauca. Results The evaluation
   results indicated that participants found the dashboard reliable and
   appropriate to detect academic dishonesty behaviours in order to
   intervene in these cases. Implications But interventions are difficult
   to systematise, need an institutional policy, and there is uncertainty
   about whether these interventions can actually contribute to decreasing
   academic dishonesty.},

Abstract = {This paper presents results from our design and evaluation studies of
   the Learning Analytics Cockpit (LA Cockpit) for a quiz app, which aims
   to provide lecturers with important information about students'
   knowledge levels. We define a LA Cockpit as a tool for instructors that
   enables them to steer students' learning process by providing a LA
   Dashboard which visualizes students' learning indicators and an
   intervention feature enabling instructors to give feedback based on
   students' knowledge levels. To address the needs of lecturers we applied
   the Double Diamond (DD) design process model which consists of four
   stages: discover, define, develop \& refine. Following the DD process,
   we first conducted a qualitative study by interviewing four lecturers
   and student teachers to discover their needs. Results from the
   interviews allowed us to define requirements of the lecturers. We used
   these results to develop the first version of the tool where we refined
   it through informal feedback by the interviewed teachers. In preparation
   for a larger effectiveness-study, we evaluated the LA Cockpit in terms
   of usefulness and usability in a preliminary study with 16 university
   lecturers. Results from this qualitative study indicate that the LA
   Cockpit can measure the students' knowledge level and supports
   self-reflection for lecturers. Moreover, results show that the LA
   Cockpit enables lecturers to address knowledge gaps and provide
   interventions to students before the exams.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach in the Multimodal Learning
   Analytics field. Within this approach, we have developed a tool to
   visualize and analyze eye movement data collected during learning
   sessions in online courses. The tool is named VAAD -an acronym for
   Visual Attention Analysis Dashboard-. These eye movement data have been
   gathered using an eye-tracker and subsequently processed and visualized
   for interpretation. The purpose of the tool is to conduct a descriptive
   analysis of the data by facilitating its visualization, enabling the
   identification of differences and learning patterns among various
   learner populations. Additionally, it integrates a predictive module
   capable of anticipating learner activities during a learning session.
   Consequently, VAAD holds the potential to offer valuable insights into
   online learning behaviors from both descriptive and predictive
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are emerging tools that convert
   abstract, complex information with visualizations to facilitate
   teachers' data-driven pedagogical decision-making. While many LADs have
   been designed, teachers' capacities for using such LADs are not well
   articulated in the literature. To fill the gap, this study provided a
   conceptual definition highlighting data visualization literacy and
   integrating abilities as two critical components in LAD capacities.
   Moreover, this study assessed teachers' LAD capacities through a
   knowledge test and examined the combined effect of teachers'
   self-regulation, emotions, perceptions of LAD usefulness and ease of
   use, and online teaching experience on teachers' achievements of the LAD
   capacity knowledge test. The results of a Bayesian path analysis based
   on the sample of 150 teachers show that (1) teachers' self-regulation
   and perceived LAD usefulness were the two main factors that made
   significant impacts on their LAD capacities, (2) the factors of negative
   emotions and perceived ease of use had effects on teachers' LAD
   capacities, but such effects were mediated by self-regulation and
   perceived usefulness, and (3) online teaching experience had little
   effect on LAD capacities. This is the first study that conceptually
   researches teachers' capacities for LAD uses. The findings offer novel
   perspectives into the complexity of LAD using process and demonstrate
   the importance of teachers' self-regulation, emotions, and perceptions
   of usefulness in enhancing teachers' abilities to use LADs for
   pedagogical decisions and actions.},

Abstract = {Developing data visualisation tools to support academics in the

   way. This large university has a maturing learning analytics unit, a
   new, data-friendly LMS system, and data-savvy and data-hungry executive
   leadership. Yet the experienced pathway and evolutionary steps evidence
   the points that need be resolved to successfully deliver and transition
   to learning analytics solutions that have previously been conceptually
   proposed or tested at small scales in other studies. The key findings
   through the process highlight the level of uplift (in tech, capacity and

Abstract = {Being a promising constructionist pedagogy in recent years, maker
   education empowers students to take agency of their learning process
   through constructing both knowledge and real-world physical or digital
   products and fosters peer interactions for collective innovation.
   Learning Analytics (LA) excels at generating personalized, fine-grained
   feedback in near real-time and holds much potential in supporting
   process-oriented and peer-supported learning activities, including maker
   activities. In the context of virtual reality (VR) content creation for
   cultural heritage education, this study qualitatively solicited 27
   students' needs on progress monitoring, reflection, and feedback during
   their making process. Findings have inspired the prototype design of a
   student-facing LA dashboard (LAVR). Leveraging multimodal learning
   analytics (MmLA) such as text and audio analytics to fulfill students'
   needs, the prototype has various features and functions including
   automatic task reminders, content quality detection, and real-time
   feedback on quality of audio-visual elements. A preliminary evaluation
   of the prototype with 10 students confirms its potential in supporting
   students' self-regulated learning during the making process and for
   improving the quality of VR content. Implications on LA design for
   supporting maker education are discussed. Future work is planned to
   include implementation and evaluation of the dashboard in classrooms.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},

Pages = {149-167},
Abstract = {The progressive move of higher education institutions (HEIs) towards
   blended and online environments, accelerated by COVID-19, and their
   access to a greater variety of student data has heightened the need for
   ethical learning analytics (LA). This need is particularly salient in
   light of a lack of comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines on ethics
   that address gaps voiced in LA ethics research. Studies on the topic are
   predominantly conceptual, representing mainly institutional rather than
   stakeholder views, with some areas of ethics remaining underexplored. In
   this paper, we address this need by using a case of four years of
   interdisciplinary research in developing the award-winning Early Alerts
   Indicators (EAI) dashboard at a distance learning university. Through a
   lens focused on ethical considerations and informed by the practical
   approach to ethics, we conducted a case study review, using 10 relevant
   publications that report on the development and implementation of the
   tool. Our six practical recommendations on how to ethically engage with
   LA can inform an ethical development of LA that not only protects
   student privacy, but also ensures that LA tools are used in ways that
   effectively support student learning and development.},

Abstract = {Unequal stakeholder engagement is a common pitfall of adoption
   approaches of learning analytics in higher education leading to lower
   buy-in and flawed tools that fail to meet the needs of their target
   groups. With each design decision, we make assumptions on how learners
   will make sense of the visualisations, but we know very little about how
   students make sense of dashboard and which aspects influence their
   sense-making. We investigated how learner goals and self-regulated
   learning (SRL) skills influence dashboard sense-making following a
   mixed-methods research methodology: a qualitative pre-study followed-up
   with an extensive quantitative study with 247 university students. We
   uncovered three latent variables for sense-making: transparency of
   design, reference frames and support for action. SRL skills are
   predictors for how relevant students find these constructs. Learner
   goals have a significant effect only on the perceived relevance of
   reference frames. Knowing which factors influence students' sense-making
   will lead to more inclusive and flexible designs that will cater to the
   needs of both novice and expert learners.},

Abstract = {The current shift from traditional classrooms to online learning in
   higher education calls for more attention to selfregulated learning.
   This research is motivated by the growing interest in potential of using
   learning analytics dashboard (LAD) to increase individuals'
   self-regulation by creating visibility into their performance in various
   applications. This study explores how data visualization can be
   integrated with online learning to improve learners' performance through
   enhancing their skills in planning and organization. We are working on
   the design of a comprehensive LAD, focusing on micro-level of learning
   analytics to support learning activities of students. The LAD includes
   the following two features to enhance students' self-regulation in
   online learning: (1) a function to track students' progress compared to
   other students' over time; (2) reminders to help students with upcoming
   deadlines and auto-generating to do lists. The hypothesis is that the
   LAD will increase students' engagement, motivation, and self-regulation
   in an online learning environment. This study is significant because it
   contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring how student-generated
   data can be used to improve selfregulated learning. The practical
   contribution of this study is to create a personalized LAD for students
   based on the learnergenerated data to benefit students' organization
   skill, planning skill, and motivation.},

Abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of universities and even junior
   and senior high schools have begun introducing e-portfolio systems.
   However, in many cases the students' motivation is limited to simply
   accumulating their e-portfolio. As a result, the independence of
   students is lost and the learning is considered not to have worked. Also
   attracting attention recently is the use of learning analytics to
   analyze and utilize learning record data. As a tool for the
   visualization of the analysis results, the dashboard, which makes it
   easy to check information at a glance, has been attracting attention.
   Our purpose with this study is to promote e-portfolio-based learning on
   e-portfolio systems. Specifically, to provide the analysis result of the
   learning record data accumulated in an e-portfolio system, we developed
   a dashboard that visualizes the status of student engagement and
   collaboration in terms of ``engagement{''}, ``collaboration{''}, and
   ``collaborative community{''}. We also evaluated our dashboard to
   determine its effect on e-portfolio-based learning.},

Abstract = {Learning technologies are generating a vast quantity of data every day.
   This data is often presented to students through learning analytics
   dashboards (LADs) with a goal of improving learners' self-regulated
   learning. However, are students actually using these dashboards, and do
   they perceive that using dashboards lead to any changes in their
   behavior? In this paper we report on the development and implementation
   of several dashboard views, which we call My Learning Analytics (MyLA).
   This study found that students thought using the dashboard would have
   more of an effect on the way they planned their course activity at
   pre-use (after a demo) than post use. Low self-regulated learners
   believed so significantly less post-use and used the grade distribution
   view the least. Students made several suggestions for ways to improve
   the grade distribution view and rated MyLA's usability more positively
   at pre- than post-use. Given the low use and low perceived impact of the
   current dashboard, we suggest that researchers use participatory design
   to illicit students' needs and better incorporate student suggestions.},

Abstract = {With the development of a technology-supported environment, it is
   plausible to provide rich process-oriented feedback in a timely manner.
   In this paper, we developed a learning analytics dashboard (LAD) based
   on process-oriented feedback in iTutor to offer learners their final
   scores, sub-scale reports, and corresponding suggestions on further
   learning content. We adopted a quasi-experimental design to investigate
   the effectiveness of the report on students' learning. Ninety-four
   freshman from two classes participated in this research. The two classes
   were divided into the LAD group and the original analytics report (OAR)
   based on a product-oriented feedback group. Before the experiment, all
   the students took the prior knowledge assessment. After a semester's
   instruction, all the students took the post-test of the summative
   assessment. Results indicated that students in the LAD group experienced
   better learning effectiveness than students in the OAR group. LAD based
   on process-oriented feedback was also effective in improving the skill
   learning effectiveness of the students with low-level prior knowledge.},

Abstract = {Mobile and ubiquitous technologies have been applied to a wide range of
   learning fields such as science, social science, history and language
   learning. Many researchers have been investigating the development of
   ubiquitous learning environments; nevertheless, to date, there have not
   been enough research works related to the reflection, analysis and
   traces of learners' activities in the history of ubiquitous learning
   environment. Therefore this paper presents a research on the design and
   development of a dashboard function which proposes new opportunity for
   ubiquitous learning. The dashboard captures, analyzes and visualizes
   traces of learning activities in order to promote awareness and enables
   learners to reflect on their own activity and helps to recall what they
   have learned. An initial evaluation has been conducted with 14
   international students. Results indicate that the dashboard is a useful
   tool for self-reflection on activities and recall what learners have
   learned by repeated quizzes.},

Abstract = {Student-facing learning analytics dashboards aim to help students to
   monitor their study progress, achieve learning goals and develop
   self-regulation skills. Only few of them present personalised data
   visualisations and aim to develop agentic students who take remedial
   action to improve their study habits, learning and performance. In this
   paper, a student-facing dashboard, designed following principles of
   participatory research, was tested with 30 undergraduate students, who
   engaged with it over a period of 4 to 15 weeks and while studying an
   online course. This is one of the few dashboards available that presents
   all different types of analytics to students: descriptive, predictive
   and prescriptive. A mixed methods approach was used to assess its
   usefulness and impact on motivation to study and take remedial action to
   support learning. Data analysis show-cased that such a dashboard can be
   ``a roadmap to success{''} by motivating students to study more and
   improve their performance, in addition to helping with monitoring,
   planning and reflection. While all dashboard features were perceived as
   being useful, special value was placed on prescriptive elements, in
   particular material recommendations and contacting tutors and university
   support teams, emphasizing the significance of making explicit on a
   dashboard the actions students should take to improve their performance.
   Implications for future studies are discussed.},

Abstract = {Technology supported learning is nowadays often based on heterogeneous
   environments that encompass not only one application and also possibly
   involve different devices. This creates specific challenges for data
   analysis and thus for learning analytics. In this paper, we propose a
   framework to create reusable learning analytics components that are
   portable to different target platforms. In this approach, the logic of
   each analysis component is specified in a separate web-based visual
   environment (or ``workbench{''}) from where it is later exported to the
   target environments form of a gadget-based dashboard. We demonstrate
   this mechanism in the context of the Go-Lab portal for accessing remote
   laboratories in STEM learning scenarios. An example shows how such
   analytics gadgets can be used to support collaboration inside the
   classroom.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards commonly visualize data about students
   with the aim of helping students and educators understand and make
   informed decisions about the learning process. To assist with making
   sense of complex and multidimensional data, many learning analytics
   systems and dashboards have relied strongly on AI algorithms based on
   predictive analytics. While predictive models have been successful in
   many domains, there is an increasing realization of the inadequacies of
   using predictive models in decision-making tasks that affect individuals
   without human oversight. In this paper, we employ a suite of
   state-of-the-art algorithms, from the online analytics processing, data
   mining, and process mining domains, to present an alternative
   human-in-the-loop AI method to enable educators to identify, explore,
   and use appropriate interventions for subpopulations of students with
   the highest deviation in performance or learning process compared to the
   rest of the class. We demonstrate an application of our proposed
   approach in an existing learning analytics dashboard (LAD) and explore
   the recommended drill-downs in a course with 875 students. The
   demonstration provides an example of the recommendations from real
   course data and shows how recommendations can lead the user to
   interesting insights. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our approach can
   be employed to develop intelligent LADs.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) can help provide insights and
   inform pedagogical decisions by supporting the analysis of large amounts
   of educational data, obtained from sources such as Digital Learning
   Materials (DLMs). Extracting requirements is a crucial step in
   developing a LAD, as it helps identify the underlying design problem
   that needs to be addressed. In fact, determining the problem that
   requires a solution is one of the primary objectives of requirements
   extraction. Although there have been studies on the development of LADs
   for K12 education, these studies have not specifically emphasized the
   use of a Human-Centered Design (HCD) approach to better comprehend the
   teachers' requirements and produce more stimulating insights. In this
   paper we apply prototyping, which is widely acknowledged as a successful
   way for rapidly implementing cost-effective designs and efficiently
   gathering stakeholder feedback, to elicit such requirements. We present
   a three-step HCD approach, involving a design cycle that employs paper
   and interactive prototypes to guide the systematic and effective design
   of LADs that truly meet teacher requirements in primary/secondary
   education, actively engaging them in the design process. We then
   conducted interviews and usability testing to co-design and develop a
   LAD that can be used in classroom's everyday learning activities. Our
   results show that the visualizations of the interactive prototype were
   easily interpreted by the participants, verifying our initial goal of
   co-developing an easy-to-use LAD.},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in creating
   multimodal learning analytics (LA) systems that automatically analyse
   students' states that are hard to see with the ``naked eye{''}, such as
   cognitive load and stress levels, but that can considerably shape their
   learning experience. A rich body of research has focused on detecting
   such aspects by capturing bodily signals from students using wearables
   and computer vision. Yet, little work has aimed at designing end-user
   interfaces that visualise physiological data to support tasks
   deliberately designed for students to learn from stressful situations.
   This paper addresses this gap by designing a stress analytics dashboard
   that encodes students' physiological data into stress levels during
   different phases of an authentic team simulation in the context of
   nursing education. We conducted a qualitative study with teachers to
   understand (i) how they made sense of the stress analytics dashboard;
   (ii) the extent to which they trusted the dashboard in relation to
   students' cortisol data; and (iii) the potential adoption of this tool
   to communicate insights and aid teaching practices.},

Abstract = {The need to personalize learning analytics dashboards (LADs) is getting
   more recognized in learning analytics research community. In order to
   study the impact of these dashboards on learners, various types of
   prototypes have been designed and deployed in different settings.
   Applying Weiner's attribution theory, our goal in this study was to
   understand the effect of dashboard information content on learners. We
   wanted to understand how elements of assignment grade, time spent on an
   assignment, assignment view, and proficiency in the dashboard affect
   students' attribution of achievement and motivation for future work. We
   designed a qualitative study in which we analyzed participants'
   responses and indicated behavioural changes after viewing the dashboard.
   Through in-depth interviews, we aimed to understand students'
   interpretations of the designed dashboard, and to what extent social
   comparison impacts their judgments of learning. Students used multiple
   dimensions to attribute their success or failure to their ability and
   effort. Our results indicate that to maximize the benefits of dashboards
   as a vehicle for motivating change in students learning, the dashboard
   should promote effort in both personal and social comparison capacities.},

Abstract = {This study is based on a novel conceptual framework, precision
   education, and takes a blended Python programming course as an example
   to explore how to implement precision education that includes diagnosis,
   prediction, prevention and treatment. Precision education follows the
   principles of personalized services for precision medicine. Its purpose
   is to strengthen the learning risk prediction and early intervention
   mentioned in emerging learning analytics through big data, artificial
   intelligence and other emerging technologies, thereby improving teacher
   teaching quality and student learning efficiency. This study is based on
   the design of the e-book learning dashboard, so that teachers can
   quickly understand students' learning status, and improve the e-book
   through students' feedback on the dashboard to achieve precision
   diagnosis. Next, this study uses machine learning algorithms to predict
   students' learning performance, and thus determine whether students are
   at-risk to achieve precision prediction. Finally, through the
   correspondence between reading strategy and reading sequence, and then
   clearly distinguish the types of students by grouping, and use it as a
   treatment target for precision treatment and prevention. It is hoped
   that this empirical study can be used as a case study for implementing
   precision education.},

Abstract = {The affordances of learning analytics (LA) are being increasingly
   harnessed to enhance 21st century (21C) pedagogy and learning.
   Relatively rare, however, are use cases and empirically based
   understandings of students' actual experiences with LA tools and
   environments at fostering 21C literacies, especially in secondary
   schooling and Asian education contexts. This paper addresses this
   knowledge gap by 1) presenting a first iteration design of a
   computer-supported collaborative critical reading and LA environment and
   its 16-week implementation in a Singapore high school; and 2)
   foregrounding students' quantitative and qualitative accounts of the
   benefits and problematics associated with this learning innovation. We
   focus the analytic lens on the LA dashboard components that provided
   visualizations of students' reading achievement, 21C learning
   dispositions, critical literacy competencies and social learning network
   positioning within the class. The paper aims to provide insights into
   the potentialities, paradoxes and pathways forward for designing LA that
   take into consideration the voices of learners as critical stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Research on learning dashboards aims to identify what data is meaningful
   to different stakeholders in education, and how data can be presented to
   support sense-making processes. This paper summarizes the main outcomes
   of a systematic literature review on learning dashboards, in the fields
   of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining The query was run in
   five main academic databases and enriched with papers coming from
   GScholar, resulting in 346 papers out of which 55 were included in the
   final analysis. Our review distinguishes different kinds of research
   studies as well as different aspects of learning dashboards and their
   maturity in terms of evaluation. As the research field is still
   relatively young, many of the studies are exploratory and
   proof-of-concept. Among the main open issues and future lines of work in
   the area of learning dashboards, we identify the need for longitudinal
   research in authentic settings, as well as studies that systematically
   compare different dashboard design options.},

Abstract = {The majority of applications and products that use learning analytics to
   understand and improve learning experiences assume the creation of
   actionable items that will affect students through an intermediary. Much
   less focus is devoted to exploring how to provide insight directly to
   students. Furthermore, student engagement has always been a relevant
   aspect to increase the quality of a learning experience. Learning
   analytics techniques can be used to provide real-time insight tightly
   integrated with the learning outcomes directly to the students. This
   paper describes a case study deployed in a first year engineering course
   using a flipped learning strategy to explore the behavior of students
   interacting with a dashboard updated in real time providing indicators
   of their engagement with the course activities. The results show
   different patterns of use and their evolution throughout the experience
   and shed some light on how students perceived this resource.},

Abstract = {Most higher education institutions view their increasing use of learning
   analytics as having significant potential to improve student academic
   achievement, retention outcomes, and learning and teaching practice but
   the realization of this potential remains stubbornly elusive. While
   there is an abundance of published research on the creation of
   visualizations, dashboards, and predictive models, there has been little
   work done to explore the impact of learning analytics on the actual
   practice of teachers. Through the lens of social informatics (an
   approach that views the users of technologies as active social actors
   whose technological practices constitute a wider socio-technical system)
   this qualitative study reports on an investigation into the practice of
   30 tutors in the STEM faculty at Europe's largest distance learning
   organization, The Open University UK (OU). When asked to incorporate
   learning analytics (including predictive learning analytics) contained
   in the Early Alert Indicator (EAI) dashboard during the 2017-2018
   academic year into their practice, we found that tutors interacted with
   this dashboard in certain unanticipated ways and developed three
   identifiable ``shadow practices{''}.},

Abstract = {Team teaching in higher education can be challenging, especially for
   educators managing large classes with limited pedagogical training and
   few opportunities to reflect on their practices. Emerging sensing
   technologies and analytics can capture and analyse patterns of
   collaboration, communication, and movement of team teaching. Yet, few
   studies have presented these data to educators for reflection. To
   address this gap, we examine the benefits, challenges, and concerns of
   presenting multimodal teaching data (positional, audio, and spatial
   pedagogy observations) to educators via the TeamTeachingViz dashboard.
   We evaluated TeamTeachingViz in an authentic classroom context where
   educators explored their own data and team teaching strategies.
   Multimodal data was collected from 36 in-the-wild classroom sessions
   involving 12 educators grouped in various combinations over 4 weeks,
   followed by semi-structured interviews to reflect on their practices.
   Findings suggest that educators improved their self-awareness by using
   data-driven insights to understand their movements and interactions,
   enabling continuous improvement in team teaching. However, they noted
   the need for additional data, such as student behaviours and speech
   content, to better contextualise these insights.},

   determining relevant predictors, and a dashboard for informing learners.
   The overall approach was based on mirroring, the idea that learners see
   themselves operating in the context of their peers. The results were
   informative in terms of pro's and con's regarding the design and

   our experience developing dashboards to support middle school
   mathematics teachers' pedagogical practices, in a multi-university,
   multi-school district, improvement science initiative in the United
   States. Through documentation of our design experience, we offer ways to
   adapt common HCD methods - contextual design and design tensions - when
   developing visual analytics systems for educators. We also illuminate
   how adopting these design methods within the context of improvement
   science and research-practice partnerships fundamentally influences the
   design choices we make and the focal questions we undertake. The results
   of this design process flow naturally from the appropriation and
   repurposing of tools by district partners and directly inform
   improvement goals.},

   content creation with learning analytics functions. We design the
   platform where students can easily create VR stories through a web
   interface. A learning analytics dashboard is implemented to provide
   students with feedback on their progress and the quality of the textual
   content in their VR stories. The platform also offers learning
   management features for helping teachers set up classrooms with
   assignments. While the platform will be employed in a forthcoming
   general education course, we have conducted a preliminary usability
   evaluation with 12 students and one teacher, and gathered feedback for
   further refinements before its official launch. The platform will
   contribute to integrating learning analytics with maker activities.},

Abstract = {Use of online learning systems, such as learner dashboards, is
   increasing in university chemistry courses. Learning analytics can
   support student learning by providing feedback on concept mastery. This
   paper investigated how student use of a chemistry learner dashboard
   might be increased through class structure, instructor practice, and
   dashboard design changes across three iterations in a general chemistry
   course. Once acceptable levels of student dashboard use were achieved,
   further investigation of how students interacted with the dashboard,
   including accessing the variety of available resources, was conducted.
   Survey data and clickstream data from the dashboard were collected and
   analyzed in a convergent mixed methods design. This study found that
   changes in course structure, teacher practice, and dashboard design
   increased use of the dashboard and utilization of the variety of
   materials offered in it. Recommendations for instructors to effectively
   utilize a learner dashboard and increase student trust in the system are
   provided.},

Abstract = {Using games for education can increase the motivation and engagement of
   students and provide a more authentic learning environment where
   students can learn, test and apply new knowledge. However, the actual
   (serious) game application in schools is still limited, partly because
   teachers consider their use as a complex process. To increase game
   adoption, the integration of Game Learning Analytics (GLA) can provide
   teachers a thorough insight into the knowledge acquired by their
   students and usually presented through a visual dashboard. Although it
   is possible to provide a useful general metrics and a prefab dashboard,
   it may not fully cover teachers' expectations. In this paper, we study
   the ad-hoc adaptation of generic dashboards to increase their
   effectiveness through three case-studies. In these experiences, we adapt
   dashboards for teachers to include detailed information for more-focused
   analysis. With the positive results obtained from these scenarios, we
   have identified a methodological process to create ad-hoc GLA dashboards
   and extracted some lessons learned for dashboard development: simple but
   useful dashboards can provide a higher added value for stakeholders
   compared with more complex dashboards; teachers and game developers
   should be involved in dashboard design for better results; and, if
   possible, ad-hoc developed dashboards should be used as they have proved
   to be more effective than generic dashboards.},

Journal = {SMART LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The availability of large-scale learning data presents unprecedented
   opportunities for investigating student learning processes. However, it
   is challenging for instructors to fully make sense of this data and
   effectively support their teaching practices. This study introduces
   LearningViz, an interactive learning analytics dashboard to help
   instructors identify, analyze, and close performance gaps among students
   in their classes. In this dashboard, we incorporated three modules to
   enhance human and computer interactions for better supporting the
   teaching practices: the Student Overall Performance Analysis Module,
   which provides a comprehensive understanding of students' learning in
   the course; the Student Group Performance Analysis Module, which
   examines performance gaps across different groups and identifies factors
   contributing to these gaps; and the Final Exam Item Analysis Module,
   which evaluates the quality of exam questions and identifies strategies
   for closing performance gaps. The overall design of the platform follows
   a user-centered approach, integrating data analysis with various
   visualization strategies in a unified platform. A case study is then
   conducted to highlight the effectiveness of LearningViz in supporting
   instructors analyzing students' learning patterns and associated factors
   impacting learning performance. We further conduct a usability test with
   several domain experts, to evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of
   this platform in supporting the teaching practices. Our findings
   underscore the platform's ability to support instructors in detecting
   performance gaps among students, investigating influential factors,
   evaluating assessment quality and implementing targeted instructional
   strategies for closing performance gaps.},

Title = {Staying on target: A systematic literature review on learner-facing
   learning analytics dashboards},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1724-1748},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The advances in technology to capture and process unprecedented amounts
   of educational data has boosted the interest in Learning Analytics
   Dashboard (LAD) applications as a way to provide meaningful visual
   information to administrators, parents, teachers and learners. Despite
   the frequent argument that LADs are useful to support target users and
   their goals to monitor and act upon the information provided, little is
   known about LADs' theoretical underpinnings and the alignment (or lack
   thereof) between LADs intended outcomes and the measures used to
   evaluate their implementation. However, this knowledge is necessary to
   illuminate more efficient approaches in the development and
   implementation of LAD tools. Guided by the self-regulated learning
   perspective and using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework, this systematic literature
   review addressed this gap by examining whether and how learner-facing
   LAD's target outcomes align with the domain measures used to evaluate
   their implementations. Out of the 1297 papers retrieved from 15
   databases, 28 were included in the final quantitative and qualitative
   analysis. Results suggested an intriguing lack of alignment between
   LADs' intended outcomes (mostly cognitive domain) and their evaluation
   (mostly affective measures). Based on these results and on the premise
   that LADs are designed to support learners, a critical recommendation
   from this study is that LADs' target outcomes should guide the selection
   of measures used to evaluate the efficacy of these tools. This alignment
   is critical to enable the construction of more robust guidelines to
   inform future endeavours in the field.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic
   There has been an increased interest and investment in learning
   analytics dashboards to support learners as end-users.
   Learner-facing learning analytics dashboards are designed with different
   purposes, functionalities and types of data in an attempt to influence
   learners' behaviour, achievement and skills.
   What this paper adds
   This paper reports trends and opportunities regarding the design of
   learner-facing learning analytics dashboards, contexts of
   implementation, as well as types and features of learner-facing learning
   analytics dashboard studies.
   The paper discusses how affect and motivation have been largely
   overlooked as target outcomes in learner-facing learning analytics
   dashboards.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Based on the evidence gathered through the review, this paper makes
   recommendations for theory (eg, inclusion of motivation as an important
   target outcome).
   The paper makes recommendations related to the design, implementation
   and evaluation of learning analytics dashboards.
   The paper also highlights the need for further integration between
   learner-facing learning analytics dashboards and open learner models.},

   that, while many see the educational benefits of learning analytics
   (e.g., more equitable instruction, individualized learning, enhanced
   assessment for learning); others remain unconvinced by a lack of
   evidence of improved outcomes and concerned about persistent challenges
   and potentially harmful impacts (e.g., infringement on users' privacy,
   misuse or misinterpretation of data by educators). We conclude by
   considering implications for mathematics education stemming from our
   analysis of learning analytics and posing questions to shape future
   research and key developments in mathematics education as learning

Abstract = {This paper presents a real-time teacher dashboard optimized to support
   agile classroom orchestration based on a Kanban board. The implemented
   prototype allows teachers to prepare and implement lessons and monitor
   student progress in real-time. Teachers can easily duplicate Kanban
   boards for multiple groups and identify groups of students who are
   falling behind or excelling and may need special support. Students can
   access and use the prepared Kanban boards in a privacy friendly way,
   raise their hand virtually, and upload their work for review. The
   prototype was used and evaluated in two case studies. The results
   indicate that the developed prototype with its features including the
   dashboard is usable and helpful for preparing, implementing, and
   reviewing lessons. Implications and future work are discussed.},

Journal = {ELECTRONICS},

Abstract = {MOOCs offer great learning opportunities, but they also present several
   challenges for learners that hinder them from successfully completing
   MOOCs. To address these challenges, edX-LIMS (System for Learning
   Intervention and its Monitoring for edX MOOCs) was developed. It is a
   learning analytics system that supports an intervention strategy (based
   on learners' interactions with the MOOC) to provide feedback to learners
   through web-based Learner Dashboards. Additionally, edX-LIMS provides a
   web-based Instructor Dashboard for instructors to monitor their
   learners. In this article, an enhanced version of the aforementioned
   system called edX-LIMS+ is presented. This upgrade introduces new
   services that enhance both the learners' and instructors' dashboards
   with a particular focus on self-regulated learning. Moreover, the system
   detects learners' problems to guide them and assist instructors in
   better monitoring learners and providing necessary support. The results
   obtained from the use of this new version (through learners'
   interactions and opinions about their dashboards) demonstrate that the
   feedback provided has been significantly improved, offering more
   valuable information to learners and enhancing their perception of both
   the dashboard and the intervention strategy supported by the system.
   Additionally, the majority of learners agreed with their detected
   problems, thereby enabling instructors to enhance interventions and
   support learners' learning processes.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},

Pages = {297-312},
Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is a rapidly growing area of research that
   focuses on using data from learning technologies to improve the quality
   of students' outcomes. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive
   understanding of the current state of research on learning analytics
   technologies and how they can positively impact student outcomes. To
   achieve this, a systematic review using a PRISMA methodology was
   conducted. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select
   relevant papers, resulting in a final set of 31 papers for analysis. The
   identified papers were then organised and analysed. The findings show
   that the use of learning analytics has many benefits for both learners
   and instructors. However, its adoption by higher educational
   institutions has been slow and limited due to a lack of resources,
   funding, and skills. Four systematic reviews on the topic have been
   conducted, but they do not reveal any significant changes in the status
   of research and practice over the years. The analysed papers highlight
   the use of learning analytics for predicting student learning behaviours
   and identifying at-risk students who may benefit from targeted
   interventions. These interventions have been shown to improve students'
   academic performance and retention rates. Furthermore, learning
   analytics has also been used for technology enhanced learning and to
   improve overall academic outcomes for students. Moving forward, it is
   crucial to focus on overcoming the barriers to adoption that hinder the
   widespread use of learning analytics in higher education. Additionally,
   exploring alternative options beyond the traditional dashboard-based
   approach could offer new insights and improve the overall effectiveness
   of learning analytics systems. This research has implications for
   universities, learning staff and students.},

Abstract = {Knowledge building (KB) is an educatioanl theory framework that shows
   interest in the benefits that the technology offers to teaching and

   assessment of KB communities supported by the knowlege forum platform
   was evaluated. The design-based research study was conducted with 126
   undergraduate students enrolled in an educational research course at the
   University of (Name, country). Using a survey methodology, data was
   collected on the students' perception regarding epistemic collective
   agency, research skills, and dashboard assessment. The conclusions about
   the value of the dashboard are broken down into two axes. On the one
   hand, the students state that they are satisfied with the dashboard,
   although they indicate that there is room for improvement. On the other
   hand, according to the KB reflective assessment, the dahsboard provided
   students with educational experiences that have empowered them in the
   collaborative construction of knowledge and promoted the development of
   their specific educational research skills. Future technological
   improvements and implementations of the Knowledge Building are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {Online discussion plays an increasingly significant role in asynchronous
   online learning environments. While previous attempts have been made to
   develop learning analytics dashboards to facilitate such discussions,
   most of these dashboards have been designed without reference to data or
   visualization techniques that have been proven to make online
   discussions more effective. This study identified the difficulties and
   inconveniences experienced by learners in online discussion activities
   and generated a set of visual design guidelines for overcoming them.
   Applying these guidelines, a set of learning analytics dashboards were
   developed and evaluated. The study was conducted according to
   prototyping methodology, which yielded five prototype dashboards that
   display information on participation, interaction, discussion content
   keywords, discussion message types, and the distribution of debate
   opinions, respectively. The developed dashboards were then revised and
   refined in a three-step process: (1) expert validation to verify that
   the dashboards complied with the visual guidelines and provided learners
   with the information they needed; (2) tests to identify usability
   problems, collect qualitative and quantitative data, and determine
   participant satisfaction; and (3) user experience evaluations to
   determine how learners and instructors perceived their interactions with
   the dashboards. Practical and empirical discussions are provided based
   on the results, which offer a valuable base of user experience data that
   can be used in future studies.},

   Analytics: A Systematic Literature Review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has opened new possibilities
   for designing learning analytics (LA) tools, gaining new insights about
   student learning processes and their environment, and supporting
   teachers in assessing and monitoring students. This systematic
   literature review maps the empirical research of 41 papers utilizing
   GenAI and LA and interprets the results through the lens of the LA/EDM
   process cycle. Currently, GenAI is mostly implemented to automate
   discourse coding, scoring, or classification tasks. Few papers used
   GenAI to generate data or to summarize text. Classroom integrations of
   GenAI and LA mostly explore facilitating human-GenAI collaboration,
   rather than implementing automated feedback generation or GenAI-powered
   learning analytics dashboards. Most papers use Generative Adversarial
   Network models to generate synthetic data, BERT models for
   classification or prediction tasks, BERT or GPT models for discourse
   coding, and GPT models for tool integration. Although most studies
   evaluate the GenAI output, we found examples of using GenAI without the
   output validation, especially when its output feeds into an LA pipeline
   aiming to, for example, develop a dashboard. This review offers a
   comprehensive overview of the field to aid LA researchers in the design
   of research studies and a contribution to establishing best practices to
   integrate GenAI and LA.},

   part of the institutional toolbox, the need for more empirical evidences
   about the effects for LA on the actual stakeholders, i.e. learners and
   teachers, is increasing. Within this paper we report about a further
   evaluation iteration of the Evaluation Framework for Learning Analytics
   (EFLA) that provides an efficient and effective measure to get insights
   into the application of LA in educational institutes. For this empirical
   study we have thus developed and implemented several LA widgets into a
   MOOC platform's dashboard and evaluated these widgets using the EFLA as
   well as the framework itself using principal component and reliability
   analysis. The results show that the EFLA is able to measure differences
   between widget versions. Furthermore, they indicate that the framework
   is highly reliable after slightly adapting its dimensions.},

   provide a number of challenges for students. Many students find it

   feedback. Additionally, the instructors of these courses are highly
   concerned about this situation and want to reduce these difficulties for
   their students. Due to the large number of students registered in these
   courses, this is not a simple task. To help both instructors and
   students, we created edX-LIMS, a learning analytics (LA) system that
   allows MOOC instructors to monitor the progress of their students and
   carry out an intervention strategy in their students' learning thanks to
   a Web-based Instructor Dashboard. Furthermore, this LA system provides
   MOOC students with detailed feedback on their course performance as well
   as advice on how to improve it thanks to Web-based Learner Dashboards.
   This LA system have been used for more than two year in a MOOC at edX.
   During this period the Dashboards supported by the system have been
   improved, and as a result, MOOC students now appreciate the fact that
   they feel guided, engagement and motivated to complete the course, among
   other feelings. MOOC instructor have improved their student monitoring
   tasks and are better able to identify students who need assistance.
   Moreover thanks to the services that the intervention strategy supported
   by the LA system offer to them, now students and instructors feel that
   are connected.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation of a learning dashboard that supports
   the dialogue between a student and a study advisor. The dashboard was
   designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers.
   To ensure scalability to other contexts, the dashboard uses data that is
   commonly available at any higher education institute. It visualizes the
   grades of the student, an overview of the progress through the year,
   his/her position in comparison with peers, sliders to plan the next
   years and a prediction of the length of the bachelor program for this
   student in years based on historic data. The dashboard was deployed at
   KU Leuven, Belgium and used in September 2017 to support 224 sessions
   between students and study advisers. We observed twenty of these
   conversations. We also collected feedback from 101 students with
   questionnaires. Results of our observations indicate that the dashboard
   primarily triggers insights at the beginning of a conversation. The
   number of insights and the level of these insights (factual,
   interpretative and reflective) depends on the context of the
   conversation. Most insights were triggered in conversations with
   students doubting to continue the program, indicating that our dashboard
   is useful to support difficult decision-making processes.},

Title = {Ready or not? Investigating in-service teachers' integration of learning
   analytics dashboard for assessing students' collaborative problem
   solving in K-12 classrooms},

Abstract = {Collaborative problem solving (CPS) has emerged as a crucial 21st
   century competence that benefits students' studies, future careers, and
   general well-being, prevailing across disciplines and learning
   approaches. Given the complex and dynamic nature of CPS, teacher-facing
   learning analytics dashboards (LADs) have increasingly been adopted to
   support teachers' CPS assessments by analysing and visualising various
   dimensions of students' CPS. However, there is limited research
   investigating K-12 teachers' integration of LADs for CPS assessments in
   authentic classrooms. In this study, a LAD was implemented to assist
   K-12 teachers in assessing students' CPS skills in an educational game.
   Based on the person-environment fit theory, this study aimed to (1)
   examine the extent to which teachers' environmental and personal factors
   influence LAD usage intention and behaviour and (2) identify personal
   factors mediating the relationships between environmental factors and
   LAD usage intention and behaviour. Survey data of 300 in-service
   teachers from ten Chinese K-12 schools were collected and analysed using
   partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Results
   indicated that our proposed model showed strong in-sample explanatory
   power and out-of-sample predictive capability. Additionally, subjective
   norms affected technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) and
   self-efficacy, while school support affected technostress and
   self-efficacy. Moreover, subjective norms, technostress, and
   self-efficacy predicted behavioural intention, while school support,
   TPACK, and behavioural intention predicted actual behaviour. As for
   mediation effects, school support indirectly affected behavioural
   intention through self-efficacy, while subjective norms indirectly
   affected behavioural intention through self-efficacy and affected actual
   behaviour through TPACK. This study makes theoretical, methodological,
   and practical contributions to technology integration in general and LAD
   implementation in particular.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of varied types of multi-user interactive surfaces
   (such as digital whiteboards, tabletops and tangible interfaces) is
   opening a new range of applications in face-to-face (f2f) contexts. They
   offer unique opportunities for Learning Analytics (LA) by facilitating
   multi-user sensemaking of automatically captured digital footprints of
   students' f2f interactions. This paper presents an analysis of current
   research exploring learning analytics associated with the use of surface
   devices. We use a framework to analyse our first-hand experiences, and
   the small number of related deployments according to four dimensions:
   the orchestration aspects involved; the phases of the pedagogical
   practice that are supported; the target actors; and the levels of
   iteration of the LA process. The contribution of the paper is twofold:
   1) a synthesis of conclusions that identify the degree of maturity,
   challenges and pedagogical opportunities of the existing applications of
   learning analytics and interactive surfaces; and 2) an analysis
   framework that can be used to characterise the design space of similar
   areas and LA applications.},

Abstract = {Active reading (AR) strategies have learners challenge reading through
   deep engagement with the content to foster their independence and
   develop their performance and skills in reading. A number of studies
   have been conducted to examine the effectiveness of AR, yet there is no
   research that uses logs obtained from reading activities to scaffold and
   promote AR learning. Therefore, this study proposes to investigate AR
   from Learning Analytics (LA) perspectives. An e-book called BookRoll
   (BR) was used, and the logs obtained from the learning were visualized
   and shared as feedback. As part of it, we designed and developed Active
   Reading Dashboard (AR-D). In the framework of our LA-enhanced AR called
   Digitally Enhanced Active Reading (DEAR), AR experiments in language
   classes were conducted to reveal its effects. As a result, it was found
   that the process of AR could be visualized from learning logs, and DEAR
   could be applied in formal and informal learning contexts. The AR-D was
   found to influence learners' attitudes or perceptions toward reflecting
   on their own learning and striving to improve their reading strategies.
   As future work, continual implementation and verifying its application
   in different learning contexts are suggested. We shall also consider the
   importance of stakeholders' engagement in learning environments.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Learning Analytics (LA) is finding more and more
   practical adoption, alongside of continued research interest. However,
   questions about the impact of LA applications and their underpinning in
   educational science are still being raised, impeding viability of some
   LA projects at larger scale. Within this paper we describe two examples
   using student-facing LA dashboards (LAD) deployed at scale at a
   relatively low cost. Leveraging data collected by the dashboards
   themselves, usage data (N = 4070 students) and in-dashboard
   microinteractions (N = 367 students), we try to put the impact question
   in perspective. We suggest that when investment is kept limited, a
   business case with modest but realistic expatiations of returns may be
   feasible.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards are the main vehicle for providing
   educators with a visual representation of data and insights related to
   teaching and learning. Recent research has found that the data
   visualizations provided by dashboards are often very basic and do not
   take advantage of the latest research advances to analyze and depict the
   learning process. In this article, we present a success story of how we
   adapted a visualization used for research purposes for its integration
   in a dashboard for its use by teachers in daily practice. Specifically,
   we described the process of transforming and integrating a static
   sequence analysis visualization into an interactive web visualization in
   a learning analytics dashboard for monitoring students' temporal
   trajectories in educational escape rooms in real time. We interviewed
   teachers to find out how they made use of the dashboard and present a
   qualitative content analysis of their responses.},

Title = {A shared lens around sensemaking in learning analytics: What activity
   theory, definition of a situation and affordances can offer},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The paper argues that learning analytics as a research field can benefit
   from a theory-informed shared language to describe sensemaking of
   learning and teaching data. To make the case for such shared language,
   first, I critically review prominent sensemaking theories to then
   demonstrate how studies in learning analytics do not use coherent
   descriptions of sensemaking, eclectically combining the paradigms that
   have underlying differences. I then propose a conceptualization of
   sensemaking that overcomes the differences between these theories and
   explains how the concepts of activity system, the definition of the
   situation and affordances can be used to capture individual differences
   in sensemaking. The paper concludes with a preliminary framework and
   examples demonstrating its utility in raising new theoretical questions,
   informing design principles and providing shared language for
   researchers in learning analytics.Practitioner notesWhat is already
   known about this topicWhat this paper addsImplications for practice
   and/or policy Sensemaking happens when individuals try to explain
   unknown situations. Learning analytics uses sensemaking as a lens to
   understand dashboard use. Systematic analysis of sensemaking is
   essential for learning analytics. The paper notes that noticing and
   perceiving are commonly examined in learning analytics on dashboard use.
   The paper suggests a revision of fundamental assumptions in sensemaking.
   A paper proposes a toy model of sensemaking that includes
   operationalization of the definition of the situation, activity where
   sensemaking happens and processes of noticing and perceiving
   affordances. Learning analytics must examine sensemaking of data about
   teaching and learning in a systematic manner. Internal perceptions of
   the social environment and activity that are informed by the data need
   to be considered in evaluating dashboard use.},

Title = {The impact of an academic counselling learning analytics tool: Evidence
   from 3 years of use},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of academic counselling for student success,
   providing timely and personalized guidance can be challenging for higher
   education institutions. In this study, we investigate the impact of
   counselling instances supported by a learning analytics (LA) tool,
   called TrAC, which provides specific data about the curriculum and
   grades of each student. To evaluate the tool, we measured changes in
   students' performance ranking position over 3 years and compared the
   performance of students who received counselling with and without the
   tool. Our results show that using the tool is related to an improvement
   in cohort ranking. We further investigated the characteristics of
   counselled students using cluster analyses. The findings highlight the
   potential beneficial influence on academic outcomes arising from the
   provision of guidance to students regarding their course load decisions
   via TrAC-mediated counselling. This study contributes to the field of LA
   by providing evidence of the impact of counselling supported by an LA
   tool in a real-world setting over a long period of time. Our results
   suggest that incorporating LA into academic counselling practices can
   improve student success.Practitioner notes What is already known about
   this topic By analysing student performance, teaching strategies and
   resource impact, learning analytics (LA) empowers institutions to make
   informed changes in curriculum design, resource allocation and
   educational policies. Through insights into academic progress,
   engagement and behaviour, LA counselling tools enable the identification
   of at-risk students and those needing additional support. In the related
   literature, there are areas for further exploration such as
   understanding the scalability and long-term effects of interventions on
   student success and retention. What this paper adds Through rigorous
   data analysis, the paper establishes a connection between LA utilization
   and enhanced student performance, offering concrete evidence of the
   effectiveness of LA interventions. By examining various factors such as
   academic stage and course load, the research offers valuable insights
   into the contextual nuances that optimize the outcomes of LA tool-based
   support. It adds to the growing body of evidence that supports the
   efficacy of data-driven interventions in education, fostering a more
   informed and evidence-based approach to student support and success.
   Implications for practice and policy Enhanced student support
   strategies: By tailoring counselling interventions to align with the
   identified effective conditions, educators can proactively address
   individual student needs, improving academic outcomes and retention
   rates. Informed decision making: The demonstrated positive impact
   highlights the potential of similar data-driven initiatives to foster
   student success. Policymakers can consider incentivizing the adoption of
   such interventions at institutional levels. Future directions for
   research: By identifying contextual factors that influence the efficacy
   of LA interventions, it encourages further exploration into how other LA
   interventions can be optimized for specific conditions. This can guide
   the development of more precise and effective student support strategies
   in the future.},

Title = {Applying Learning Analytics to Detect Sequences of Actions and Common
   Errors in a Geometry Game},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Games have become one of the most popular activities across cultures and
   ages. There is ample evidence that supports the benefits of using games
   for learning and assessment. However, incorporating game activities as
   part of the curriculum in schools remains limited. Some of the barriers
   for broader adoption in classrooms is the lack of actionable assessment
   data, the fact that teachers often do not have a clear sense of how
   students are interacting with the game, and it is unclear if the
   gameplay is leading to productive learning. To address this gap, we seek
   to provide sequence and process mining metrics to teachers that are
   easily interpretable and actionable. More specifically, we build our
   work on top of Shadowspect, a three-dimensional geometry game that has
   been developed to measure geometry skills as well other cognitive and
   noncognitive skills. We use data from its implementation across schools
   in the U.S. to implement two sequence and process mining metrics in an
   interactive dashboard for teachers. The final objective is to facilitate
   that teachers can understand the sequence of actions and common errors
   of students using Shadowspect so they can better understand the process,
   make proper assessment, and conduct personalized interventions when
   appropriate.},

Abstract = {One of the ultimate goals of several learning analytics (LA) initiatives
   is to close the loop and support students' and teachers' reflective
   practices. Although there has been a proliferation of end-user
   interfaces (often in the form of dashboards), various limitations have
   already been identified in the literature such as key stakeholders not
   being involved in their design, little or no account for sense-making
   needs, and unclear effects on teaching and learning. There has been a
   recent call for human-centred design practices to create LA interfaces
   in close collaboration with educational stakeholders to consider the
   learning design, and their authentic needs and pedagogical intentions.
   This paper addresses the call by proposing a question-driven LA design
   approach to ensure that end-user LA interfaces explicitly address
   teachers' questions. We illustrate the approach in the context of
   synchronous online activities, orchestrated by pairs of teachers using
   audio-visual and text-based tools (namely Zoom and Google Docs). This
   study led to the design and deployment of an open-source monitoring tool
   to be used in real-time by teachers when students work collaboratively
   in breakout rooms, and across learning spaces.},

Abstract = {The use of ICT devices in the classroom for teaching has become more
   relevant in secondary education. However, the use of data driven
   technologies for supporting pedagogical practices are still limited in
   the Japanese school context. Promoting the use of ICT in the classroom
   is an important part of improving the quality of education. In this
   paper, we introduce the workflow of using e-book reader and learning

   for the research and introduced the simple dashboard for daily teaching
   and learning in their class. An end of the study period survey results
   showed that the dashboard prompted a change in the way of teaching in
   the class and also the teacher became more positive towards using
   data-driven technologies for reflecting on teaching practices.},

Abstract = {There has been a proliferation of learning analytics (LA) interfaces
   designed to support teachers, such as LA dashboards. However, although
   teacher dashboards have been extensively studied, there is limited
   understanding of the relationship between single-page or multi-page
   dashboard designs and the cognitive demands placed on teachers to use
   them. Additionally, teachers typically have varying levels of
   visualisation literacy (VL), which may make it easier or more difficult
   for them to engage with single-page versus multi-page dashboard designs.
   In this paper, we explore how teachers, with varying VL, use single-page
   and multi-page LA dashboards. We conducted a quasi-experimental study
   with 23 higher education teachers of varied VL inspecting single and
   multi-page LA dashboards. We used an eye-tracking device to measure
   cognitive load while teachers inspected the LA dashboards in online
   group work. We investigated how proxy metrics derived from eye-tracking
   data related to teachers' cognitive load varied depending on the type of
   the dashboard teacher used and the level of VL teachers have. Our
   findings suggest that the design of the LA dashboard had an impact on
   the cognitive load experienced by the teachers. Post-hoc analysis
   revealed that teachers with low VL had a marginally lower cognitive load
   when using single-page dashboards. We argue that the LA dashboard design
   for teachers should account for teachers' levels of VL and provide
   design recommendations.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, when users using information systems, they generate a large
   amount of data leaving behind a trace as a result of their interaction,
   e.g., when students access educational materials on Virtual Learning
   Environments (VLE). This has developed into what we now know as Massive
   Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which have millions of registered students.
   Due to the large amount of data that is generated within these MOOCs,
   Learning Analytics (LA) has emerged as an alternative to improve
   teaching and learning processes through data analysis. Open edX in an
   attempt to incorporate Learning Analytics into its Insights development
   platform, which provides very simple visualizations. Likewise, other
   projects have been added, which over time have become obsolete or do not
   provide sufficient support to improve the learning process of students.
   Therefore, this study proposes the design, development, and evaluation
   of a learning analytics dashboard for the Open edX platform. The tool
   will incorporate indicators of student success in its visualizations to
   improve the learning process within the platform.},

Abstract = {Educational institutions are designing, creating and evaluating courses
   to optimize learning outcomes for highly diverse student populations.
   Yet, most of the delivery is still monitored retrospectively with
   summative evaluation forms. Therefore, improvements to the course design
   are only implemented at the very end of a course, thus missing to
   benefit the current cohort. Teachers find it difficult to interpret and
   plan interventions just-in-time. In this context, Learning Analytics
   (LA) data streams gathered from `authentic' student learning activities,
   may provide new opportunities to receive valuable information on the
   students' learning behaviors and could be utilized to adjust the
   learning design already ``on the fly{''} during runtime. We presume that
   Learning Analytics applied within Learning Design (LD) and presented in
   a learning dashboard provide opportunities that can lead to more
   personalized learning experiences, if implemented thoughtfully.
   In this paper, we describe opportunities and challenges for using LA in
   LD. We identify three key opportunities for using LA in LD: (O1) using
   on demand indicators for evidence based decisions on learning design;
   (O2) intervening during the run-time of a course; and, (O3) increasing
   student learning outcomes and satisfaction. In order to benefit from
   these opportunities, several challenges have to be overcome. Following a
   thorough literature review, we mapped the identified opportunities and
   challenges in a conceptual model that considers the interaction of LA in
   LD.},

   is evaluated by measuring how well the dashboard analytics correctly
   suggest that the instructor help students classified as most in need.
   Finally, we describe a method of matching low-performing students with
   high-performing peer tutors, and show that the inclusion of peer tutors
   not only increases the amount of help given, but the consistency of help

Abstract = {Significant attention has been paid to the use of ICT by teachers,
   especially during the COVID-19 health crisis. This usage has mostly been
   captured through self-reported survey measurements. Learning analytics
   can complement such findings, by using log data to document precisely
   how long teachers use ICT, and what ICT behaviors they perform online.
   Using log data of 800 teachers, the present study documents their use of
   ICT in mathematics on a digital learning platform used across Luxembourg
   during COVID-19 remote education. Our findings confirm the large
   differences between teachers' use of ICT found in previous research,
   measured here through the time spent active on the platform. The types
   of ICT behaviors teachers engage with online, measured via the SAMR
   model, explain most of this variation. Specifically, more time on the
   platform is associated with activities that create a meaningful learning
   experience, and redefined tasks that could engage students as active
   learners. Experience with the technology, and participation in incentive
   events and teacher training, explain another significant part of this
   variation.},

Abstract = {It has been long argued that learning analytics has the potential to act
   as a ``middle space{''} between the learning sciences and data
   analytics, creating technical possibilities for exploring the vast
   amount of data generated in online learning environments. One common
   learning analytics intervention is the learning dashboard, a support
   tool for teachers and learners alike that allows them to gain insight
   into the learning process. Although several related works have
   scrutinised the state-of-the-art in the field of learning dashboards,
   none have addressed the theoretical foundation that should inform the
   design of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we
   analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences
   have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed
   at learners. Our critical examination reveals the most common
   educational concepts and the context in which they have been applied. We
   find evidence that current designs foster competition between learners
   rather than knowledge mastery, offering misguided frames of reference
   for comparison.},

Abstract = {This study contributes with a case study on redesigning three Learning
   Analytics Dashboards (LADs) of the adaptive learning platform RhapsodeTM
   with instructions for pedagogical actions. Applying self determination
   theory's elements of competence and relatedness and mental models in a
   design thinking process, the differences among the teachers perceptions
   and the designers intentions are highlighted through several methods to
   answer the questions of: How might we improve the learning analytics
   dashboards by prioritizing course instructors' perceived competence and
   relatedness? and How might we redesign learning analytics dashboards by
   including course instructors' purpose, insights, and recommending
   actions?
   These questions are answered first by developing three Role-based
   Personas of Alina Action, Niels Novice, and Paul Privacy along with
   scenarios and user stories. Second, prototypes of interfaces are
   designed and tested in three iterations showing insights, recommended
   actions, and explanation of mechanics. Feedback from the tests on the
   prototypes receives positive feedback from all teacher personas. The
   teacher persona of Niels Novice also supplies a criticism of the
   insights and recommended actions on the basis of creating undesired
   interpretation, potential bias, taking away freedom of interpretation,
   and authoritative system that ``instructs/orders{''} action.
   Additionally, the scope of the study cannot meet the persona of Paul
   Privacy's reservations on students' possible experience of surveillance.},

Abstract = {While learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are the most common form of
   LA intervention, there is limited evidence regarding their impact on
   students' learning outcomes. This systematic review synthesizes the
   findings of 38 research studies to investigate the impact of LADs on
   students' learning outcomes, encompassing achievement, participation,
   motivation, and attitudes. As we currently stand, there is no evidence
   to support the conclusion that LADs have lived up to the promise of
   improving academic achievement. Most studies reported negligible or
   small effects, with limited evidence from well-powered controlled
   experiments. Many studies merely compared users and non-users of LADs,
   confounding the dashboard effect with student engagement levels.
   Similarly, the impact of LADs on motivation and attitudes appeared
   modest, with only a few exceptions demonstrating significant effects.
   Small sample sizes in these studies highlight the need for larger-scale
   investigations to validate these findings. Notably, LADs showed a
   relatively substantial impact on student participation. Several studies
   reported medium to large effect sizes, suggesting that LADs can promote
   engagement and interaction in online learning environments. However,
   methodological shortcomings, such as reliance on traditional evaluation
   methods, self-selection bias, the assumption that access equates to
   usage, and a lack of standardized assessment tools, emerged as recurring
   issues. To advance the research line for LADs, researchers should use
   rigorous assessment methods and establish clear standards for evaluating
   learning constructs. Such efforts will advance our understanding of the
   potential of LADs to enhance learning outcomes and provide valuable
   insights for educators and researchers alike.},

Abstract = {Visual learning analytics (VLA) is becoming increasingly adopted in
   educational technologies and learning analytics dashboards to convey
   critical insights to students and educators. Yet many students
   experienced difficulties in comprehending complex VLA due to their
   limited data visualisation literacy. While conventional scaffolding
   approaches like data storytelling have shown effectiveness in enhancing
   students' comprehension of VLA, these approaches remain difficult to
   scale and adapt to individual learning needs. Generative AI (GenAI)
   technologies, especially conversational agents, offer potential
   solutions by providing personalised and dynamic support to enhance
   students' comprehension of VLA. This controlled lab study investigates
   the effectiveness of GenAI agents, particularly when integrated with
   scaffolding techniques, in improving students' comprehension of VLA. A
   randomised controlled trial was conducted with 117 higher education
   students to compare the effects of two types of GenAI agents: passive
   agents, which respond to student queries, and proactive agents, which
   utilise scaffolding questions, against standalone scaffolding in a VLA
   comprehension task. The results show that passive agents yield
   comparable improvements to standalone scaffolding both during and after
   the intervention. Notably, proactive GenAI agents significantly enhance
   students' VLA comprehension compared to both passive agents and
   standalone scaffolding, with these benefits persisting beyond the
   intervention. These findings suggest that integrating GenAI agents with
   scaffolding can have lasting positive effects on students' comprehension
   skills and support genuine learning.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are becoming more prevalent in
   higher education to help students, faculty, and staff make data-informed
   decisions. Despite extensive research on the design and implementation
   of LADs, few studies have investigated their relation to justice,
   equity, diversity, and inclusion ( JEDI). Excluding these issues in LAD
   research limits the potential benefits of LADs generally and risks
   reinforcing long-standing inequities in education. We conducted a
   critical literature review, identifying 45 relevant papers to answer
   three research questions: how is LAD research improving JEDI, ii. how
   might it maintain or exacerbate inequitable outcomes, and iii. what
   opportunities exist in this space to improve JEDI in higher education.
   Using thematic analysis, we identified four common themes: (1)
   participant identities and researcher positionality, (2) surveillance
   concerns, (3) implicit pedagogies, and (4) software development
   resources. While we found very few studies directly addressing or
   mentioning JEDI concepts, we used these themes to explore ways
   researchers could consider JEDI in their studies. Our investigation
   highlights several opportunities to intentionally incorporate JEDI into
   LAD research by sharing software resources and conducting cross-border
   collaborations, better incorporating user needs, and centering
   considerations of justice in LAD efforts to improve historical
   inequities.},

Title = {Elements of Success: Supporting at-risk student resilience through
   learning analytics},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {152},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Strategies that incorporate learning analytics are continuing to advance
   as higher education institutions work to promote student success.
   Although many of the early learning analytics applications were intended
   to help teaching professionals to identify at-risk students, some
   learning analytics applications display information on course progress
   and performance directly to students. While positive associations
   between student use of learning analytics and achievement have been
   reported, some have expressed concern that for at-risk students, low
   estimated grades might induce negative emotions, which could lead to
   disengagement or even withdrawal. However, few studies have examined the
   effects of such applications on at-risk students. Elements of Success is
   a learning analytics platform that provides students with weekly
   performance feedback, including a current estimated grade. This study
   examined the relationship between student use of Elements of Success and
   academic performance among at-risk students in an introductory chemistry
   course. Specifically, we compared final grade outcomes and the risk of
   withdrawal among students who received a low estimated grade after the
   first midterm. Results indicated that viewing performance feedback,
   including a low estimated grade, was not associated with withdrawal from
   the course for at-risk students. Furthermore, at-risk students who used
   Elements of Success were found to be resilient. After controlling for
   prior learning outcomes, demographics, and self-reported study skills,
   it was found that they were more likely to earn a final passing grade
   (C- or above) than at-risk students who never used it. The results and
   limitations are further discussed.},

Abstract = {Advancements in Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) have the potential
   to enhance the development of effective teamwork skills and foster
   reflection on collaboration dynamics in physical learning environments.
   Yet, only a few MMLA studies have closed the learning analytics loop by
   making MMLA solutions immediately accessible to educators to support
   reflective practices, especially in authentic settings. Moreover,
   deploying MMLA solutions in authentic settings can bring new challenges
   beyond logistic and privacy issues. This paper reports the design and
   use of TeamSlides, a multimodal teamwork analytics dashboard to support
   teacher-guided reflection. We conducted an in-the-wild classroom study
   involving 11 teachers and 138 students. Multimodal data were collected
   from students working in team healthcare simulations. We examined how
   teachers used the dashboard in 22 debrief sessions to aid their
   reflective practices. We also interviewed teachers to discuss their
   perceptions of the dashboard's value and the challenges faced during its
   use. Our results suggest that the dashboard effectively reinforced
   discussions and augmented teacher-guided reflection practices. However,
   teachers encountered interpretation conflicts, sometimes leading to
   mistrust or misrepresenting the information. We discuss the
   considerations needed to overcome these challenges in MMLA research.},

Abstract = {Although prior studies have shown the benefits of using learning
   analytics dashboards (LADs) in non-gamified contexts in higher
   education, few have focused on pre-college users and gamified learning
   environments. In this paper, we present the design of Gwynnette
   Dashboard, an interactive student-facing LAD for secondary school
   learners that aims at promoting mastery learning in a gamified
   intelligent tutoring system. It contains three main components: a planet
   chart with two control buttons, a connected skill progress bar with a
   skill mastery growth line, and an overall mastery progress bar. We also
   report two user-centered design changes after validating our design with
   18 students iteratively. Our preliminary evaluation of a fully-developed
   version with 2 students revealed that this dashboard with linked
   representations of skill mastery status and skill growth was easy for
   learners to understand and motivated learners to use it to regulate
   learning. Our future work will focus on broader classroom studies to
   experimentally investigate the effectiveness of this dashboard to foster
   mastery learning and growth mindset.},

   gathered contains biometric and behavioral signals including
   electroencephalogram data to measure learners' cognitive attention,
   heart rate for affective measures and visual attention from the video
   recordings. Additionally, learners' static background data and their
   learning performance measures are tracked using LOGGE tool. M2LADS
   provides opportunities to capture learners' holistic experience during
   their interactions with the learning analytic system in order to improve
   the system and the user experience of the learners.},

Abstract = {The number of students' enrolled in Higher Education online courses is
   increasing, and as a result, more data about their learning process is
   generated. The data produced can be displayed on a dashboard and help
   students in their learning process. However, teachers' perspective
   should be taken into account to define the indicators of the dashboard
   as the design of the courses could impact on the elements included on
   it. And that is precisely the aim of this paper: to define the
   indicators needed to design a student dashboard in online courses taking
   into account teachers' perspectives. This study was carried out with 10
   teachers from the Faculty of Humanities and Education from Mondragon
   Unibertsitatea. Online qualitative questionnaires were used to gather
   participants' perceptions. Results show that most of the teachers
   participating in the research study identified four indicators to design
   a student dashboard: number of times students access the course forum,
   amount of contributions in the forum, number of times students consult
   the information booklet, and number of times each student has accessed
   the course in a week time. Conclusions drawn from this study highlight
   the importance of training teachers and students on the pedagogical use
   of data visualization.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are very important tools for
   contemporary education. Not only researchers, but also schools at
   different levels of education and students are evaluating in this way
   today. A large number of studies have addressed the issue, but there are
   few studies that have explored the possibilities of transferring the
   semaphore method of formative assessment and self-assessment to the
   digital form of LADs. This study responds to the given absence and
   illuminates the built environment of the panel and its various
   functionalities using a prototype LAD. The paper contains a block
   diagram and a use case that can be used to create an application. This
   study includes evidence based on guided interviews with 8
   teacher-academics from an international university setting on the
   usefulness of LAD features, the suitability of the semaphore method, and
   the optimal frequency of teacher assessment and student self-assessment.
   The study revealed that the most useful elements were considered to be
   the simplicity of the dashboard, a user-friendly environment, the
   semaphore method allowing scaling of scores, and also colour, and the
   comparison of teacher evaluation and student self-assessment. The
   semaphore method is attractive because of its simplicity, clarity in
   assessment and transparency in tracking progress. The proposed LAD
   allows the same competency to be assessed several times in succession as
   part of progress monitoring. It is optimal to assess three times per
   semester in university settings. A practical implication of the study is
   the use of the LAD for the purpose of analyzing the causes in success
   rates at the level of degree programs, faculties or universities.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics has been widely used in the context of language
   education. Among the studies that have used this approach, many have
   developed a dashboard that aims to provide students with recommendations
   based on data so that they can act on these suggestions and improve
   their performance. To further our understanding of dashboard research,
   this study aims to replicate an earlier study using a new data mining
   strategy, association rule mining, to explore if the new strategy can
   (1) generate comparable results; and (2) provide new insights into
   feedback uptake in dashboard systems. The original study was conducted
   with 423 students at a Hong Kong university and implemented a dashboard
   for a suite of first-year composition courses. It used a classification
   tree to identify factors that could predict the uptake of tool-based and
   general recommendations made by the dashboard. After performing
   association rule mining with the original data set, this study found
   that this approach allowed for the identification of additional useful
   factors associated with the uptake of general and tool-based
   recommendations with a higher accuracy rate. The results of this study
   provide new insights for dashboard research and showcase the potential
   use of association rule mining in the context of language education.},

Abstract = {Personalized feedback is important for the learning process, but it is
   time consuming and particularly problematic in large-scale courses.
   While automatic feedback may help for self-regulated learning, not all
   forms of feedback are effective. Social comparison offers powerful
   feedback but is often loosely designed. We propose that intertwining
   meaningful feedback with well-designed peer comparison using a learning
   analytics dashboard provides a solution. Third-year bachelor students
   were randomly assigned to have access to the learning analytics
   dashboard IguideME (treatment, n=31) or no access (control, n=31).
   Dashboard users were asked to indicate their desired grade, which was
   used to construct peer-comparison groups. Personalized peer-comparison
   feedback was provided via the dashboard. The effects were studied using
   quantitative and qualitative data, including the Motivated Strategies
   for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) and the Achievement Goal Questionnaire
   (AGQ). Compared to the control group, the treatment group achieved
   higher scores for the MSLQ components ``metacognitive self
   -regulation{''} and ``peer learning,{''} and for the AGQ component
   ``other -approach{''} (do better than others). The treatment group
   performed better on reading assignments and achieved higher grades for
   high-level Bloom exam questions. These data support the hypothesis that
   personalized peer-comparison feedback can be used to improve
   self-regulated learning and academic achievement.},

Abstract = {Study success includes the successful completion of a first degree in
   higher education to the largest extent, and the successful completion of
   individual learning tasks to the smallest extent. Factors affecting
   study success range from individual dispositions (e.g., motivation,
   prior academic performance) to characteristics of the educational
   environment (e.g., attendance, active learning, social embeddedness).
   Recent developments in learning analytics, which are a socio-technical
   data mining and analytic practice in educational contexts, show promise
   in enhancing study success in higher education, through the collection
   and analysis of data from learners, learning processes, and learning
   environments in order to provide meaningful feedback and scaffolds when
   needed. This research reports a systematic review focusing on empirical
   evidence, demonstrating how learning analytics have been successful in
   facilitating study success in continuation and completion of students'
   university courses. Using standardised steps of conducting a systematic
   review, an initial set of 6220 articles was identified. The final sample
   includes 46 key publications. The findings obtained in this systematic
   review suggest that there are a considerable number of learning
   analytics approaches which utilise effective techniques in supporting
   study success and students at risk of dropping out. However, rigorous,
   large-scale evidence of the effectiveness of learning analytics in
   supporting study success is still lacking. The tested variables,
   algorithms, and methods collected in this systematic review can be used
   as a guide in helping researchers and educators to further improve the
   design and implementation of learning analytics systems.},

Volume = {50},

Abstract = {Despite the widespread implementation of learning analytics (LA)-based
   feedback systems, there exists a gap in empirical investigations
   regarding their influence on learning outcomes. Moreover, existing
   research primarily focuses on individual differences, such as
   self-regulation and motivation, overlooking the potential of feedback
   literacy (FL). FL, an emerging skill set, goes beyond comprehending
   feedback; it entails effectively applying feedback to enhance the
   learning experience. This study aims to investigate the impact of
   LA-based feedback on knowledge acquisition and transfer, specifically
   focusing on the role of FL. Ninety-five students participated in a
   quasi-experimental design with three feedback conditions: Process
   feedback with FL practice, Process feedback only, and Outcome feedback.
   The study utilized a learning environment with an LA dashboard and
   prompting features. Participants underwent pre-tests and post-tests
   evaluating their knowledge acquisition and transfer related to effective
   instructional methodologies for online teaching. The study shows that
   LA-based process feedback enhances knowledge transfer but not
   acquisition. Notably, FL moderates this impact, emphasizing its crucial
   role in maximizing LA-based feedback benefits. The study underscores the
   importance of prioritizing FL development in educational institutions.
   The study offers valuable insights into LA, FL, and learning outcomes,
   guiding informed and customized feedback practices in education.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Higher education institutions are moving to design and implement
   teacher-facing learning analytics (LA) dashboards with the hope that
   instructors can extract deep insights about student learning and make
   informed decisions to improve their teaching. While much attention has
   been paid to developing teacher-facing dashboards, less is known about
   how they are designed, implemented and evaluated. This paper presents a
   systematic literature review of existing studies reporting on
   teacher-facing LA dashboards. Out of the 1968 articles retrieved from
   several databases, 50 articles were included in the final analysis.
   Guided by several frameworks, articles were coded based on the following
   dimensions: purpose, theoretical grounding, stakeholder involvement,
   ethics and privacy, design, implementation, and evaluation criteria. The
   findings show that most dashboards are designed to increase teachers'
   awareness but with limited actionable insights to allow intervention.
   Moreover, while teachers are involved in the design process, this is
   mainly at the exploratory/problem definition stage, with little input
   beyond this stage. Most dashboards were prescriptive, less customisable,
   and implicit about the theoretical constructs behind their designs. In
   addition, dashboards are deployed at prototype and pilot stages, and the
   evaluation is dominated by self-reports and users' reactions with
   limited focus on changes to teaching and learning. Besides, only one
   study considered privacy as a design requirement. Based on the findings
   of the study and synthesis of existing literature, we propose a
   four-dimensional checklist for planning, designing, implementing and
   evaluating LA dashboards.},

Abstract = {The number of students' enrolled in Higher Education online courses is
   increasing, and as a result, more data about their learning process is
   generated. The data produced can be displayed on a dashboard and help
   students in their learning process. However, lecturers' perspective
   should be taken into account to define the indicators of the dashboard
   as the design of the courses could impact on the elements included on
   it. And that is precisely the aim of this paper: to define the
   indicators needed to design a student dashboard in online courses taking
   into account lecturers' perspectives. This study was carried out with 10
   lecturers from the Faculty of Humanities and Education from Mondragon
   Unibertsitatea. Online qualitative questionnaires were used to gather
   participants' perceptions. Results show that most of the lecturers
   participating in the research study identified four indicators to design
   a student dashboard: number of times students access the course forum,
   amount of contributions in the forum, number of times students consult
   the information booklet, and number of times each student has accessed
   the course in a week time. Conclusions drawn from this study highlight
   the importance of training lecturers and students on the pedagogical use
   of data visualization.},

Abstract = {This Research Full Paper implements a framework that harness sources of
   programming learning analytics on three computer programming courses a
   Higher Education Institution. The platform, called PredictCS,
   automatically detects lower-performing or ``at-risk{''} students in
   programming courses and automatically and adaptively sends them
   feedback. This system has been progressively adopted at the classroom
   level to improve personalized learning. A visual analytics dashboard is
   developed and accessible to Faculty. This contains information about the
   models deployed and insights extracted from student's data. By
   leveraging historical student data we built predictive models using
   student characteristics, prior academic history, logged interactions
   between students and online resources, and students' progress in
   programming laboratory work. Predictions were generated every week
   during the semester's classes. In addition, during the second half of
   the semester, students who opted-in received pseudo real-time
   personalised feedback. Notifications were personalised based on
   students' predicted performance on the course and included a programming
   suggestion from a top-student in the class if any programs submitted had
   failed to meet the specified criteria. As a result, this helped students
   who corrected their programs to learn more and reduced the gap between
   lower and higher-performing students.},

Abstract = {Developed to maximize learning performance, learning analytics
   dashboards (LAD) are becoming increasingly commonplace in education. An
   LAD's effectiveness depends on how it is used and varies according to
   users' academic levels. In this study, two LADs and a learning support
   system were used in a higher education course to support students'
   cognitive and self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies. A total of 54
   students' learning logs on three systems and their learning performance
   scores were collected; descriptive statistics of learning behaviors,
   Mann-Whitney U test, and lag sequential analysis were used to explore
   how students with different learning performances used LADs to support
   their learning. Compared to low-performers, high-performers used the
   LADs more frequently during preview and review phases and conducted more
   monitoring and reflection strategies to support their learning. Finally,
   some practical implications for improving the design and use of LADs
   were provided.},

Abstract = {One of the ultimate goals of several learning analytics (LA) initiatives
   is to close the loop and support students' and teachers' reflective
   practices. Although there has been a proliferation of end-user
   interfaces (often in the form of dashboards), various limitations have
   already been identified in the literature such as little account for
   sensemaking needs. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a
   question-driven LA design approach to ensure that end-user LA interfaces
   explicitly address teachers' questions. We illustrate this in the
   context of synchronous online activities orchestrated by pairs of
   teachers using audio-visual and text-based tools (Zoom and Google Docs).
   This led to the design of an open-source monitoring tool to be used in
   real-time by teachers when students work collaboratively in breakout
   rooms, and across learning spaces.},

Abstract = {This paper will outline the approaches taken to explore student views
   relating to the use of learning analytics systems in a higher education
   context. City, University of London, is partway through an
   institution-wide Learning Analytics project, which aims to gather
   stakeholder perspectives and identify key opportunities and
   considerations for any service implementation. Ongoing consultation with
   students, as a key stakeholder group, is integrated into the project
   approach, with the aim of ensuring that any developments have a positive
   and supportive impact on their learning.
   Learning Analytics has been defined as ``the measurement, collection,
   analysis and reporting of data about learners and their context, for the
   purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments
   in which it occurs.{''} {[}1]. There is increasing interest in the use
   of learning analytics in higher education, with many proponents
   suggesting that developments in this area could be beneficial in
   addressing a number of challenges that the sector is currently facing.
   The potential use cases are wide and varied, including gaining greater
   insights into how learning takes place, identifying students at risk of
   withdrawing, improving pass rates and delivering more personalised
   learning {[}2]. However, there are also a large number of ethical issues
   to consider where data is being used to inform student support
   approaches and pedagogy, and therefore institutional practice should be
   informed by student feedback and approached with care.
   At City, University of London, the Learning Analytics project has been
   taking a learner-centred approach to the development of policy and best
   practice around the use of analytics. Consultation activity has taken
   place with over 40 students from across all levels of University study
   and a range of disciplines. The consultation focused on delivering
   active learning workshops in which student participants first developed
   their knowledge of data and privacy, enabling them to provide informed
   viewpoints later in the sessions. Scenarios and personas were used to
   underpin discussions around ethical issues, such as making judgments
   based solely on data, the importance of treating learners as individuals
   and whether student access to analytics could have a negative emotional
   impact. Paper prototyping activities were used to encourage participants
   to consider how a student-facing learning analytics system could most
   effectively support their learning, culminating in a group activity to
   design an ideal dashboard.
   This consultation approach has resulted in valuable insights into
   students' expectations of how the University should use their personal
   and learning data, and their main concerns for ethical use, for
   inclusion in an institutional policy and code of practice. It has also
   provided in-depth feedback about how to communicate effectively with
   students about learning analytics and provided future development
   priorities for a student-facing system.},

Abstract = {In this paper, students' practices while using a Learning Content
   Management System in a blended learning environment were examined. This
   is a case study involving 337 students who attended an academic course
   based upon a blended learning approach over three years using Moodle.
   Eighteen variables depicting the students' perceptions of Moodle, as
   well as their interaction with it, were examined using four
   complementary data mining and statistical analysis approaches:
   visualisation, decision trees, class association rules and clustering.
   The analysis of the collected data shows that failure in the course was
   associated with negative attitudes and perceptions of the students
   towards Moodle. On the other hand excellent grades were associated with
   increased use of the LCMS. Requirements elicitation of a learning
   analytics dashboard, are also discussed.},

Abstract = {The present work describes the challenges faced during the development
   of a countrywide Learning Analytics study and tool focused on tracking
   and understanding the trajectories of Uruguayan students during their
   first three years of secondary education. Due to the large scale of the
   project, which covers an entire national educational system, several
   challenges and constraints were faced during its conception and
   development. Examples of key challenges were: to understand the
   different nuances of the educational system, to satisfy ethical and
   legal requirements without narrowing down the scope and potential
   novelty of the initiative and to deal with integration and
   inconsistencies in the databases. This paper presents the design
   decisions and solutions found to address or mitigate the problems found
   as a contribution to facilitate similar large-scale projects. Three main
   experiments using data mining were conducted and their results are also
   described, pointing out the feasibility of finding meaningful patterns
   that can be used by educational authorities to improve their decision
   making and foster public educational policies. Finally, the paper
   describes the use of the data and the findings of the study to create an
   interactive visual tool to explore the relationship between student
   variables, performance and persistence in the system.},

Abstract = {Learners' emotional state has proven to be a key factor for successful
   learning. Visualizing learners' emotions during synchronous on-line
   learning activities can help tutors in creating and maintaining
   socio-affective relationships with their learners. However, few
   dashboards offer emotional information on the learning activity. The
   current study focuses on synchronous interactions via a
   videoconferencing tool dedicated to foreign language training. We
   collected data on learners' emotions in real conditions during ten
   sessions (five sessions for two learners). We propose to adopt and
   combine different models of emotions (discrete and dimensional) and to
   use heterogeneous APIs for measuring learners' emotions from different
   data sources (audio, video, self-reporting and interaction traces).
   Based on a thorough data analysis, we propose an approach to combine
   different cues to infer information on learners' emotional states. We
   finally present the EMODA dashboard, an affective multimodal and
   contextual visual analytics dashboard, which allows the tutor to monitor
   learners' emotions and better understand their evolution during the
   synchronous learning activity.},

Pages = {59-73},
Abstract = {Purpose - The explosive growth in the number of digital tools utilized
   in everyday learning activities generates data at an unprecedented
   scale, providing exciting challenges that cross scholarly communities.
   This paper aims to provide an overview of learning analytics (LA) with
   the aim of helping members of the information and learning sciences
   communities understand how educational Big Data is relevant to their
   research agendas and how they can contribute to this growing new field.
   Design/methodology/approach - Highlighting shared values and issues
   illustrates why LA is the perfect meeting ground for information and the
   learning sciences, and suggests how by working together effective LA
   tools can be designed to innovate education.
   Findings - Analytics-driven performance dashboards are offered as a
   specific example of one research area where information and learning
   scientists can make a significant contribution to LA research. Recent
   reviews of existing dashboard studies point to a dearth of evaluation
   with regard to either theory or outcomes. Here, the relevant expertise
   from researchers in both the learning sciences and information science
   is offered as an important opportunity to improve the design and
   evaluation of student-facing dashboards.
   Originality/value - This paper outlines important ties between three
   scholarly communities to illustrate how their combined research
   expertise is crucial to advancing how we understand learning and for
   developing LA-based interventions that meet the values that we all
   share.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a new Learning Analytics dashboard which integrates
   all the information gathered by a virtual evaluation laboratory deployed
   at our institution and, also, the collaborative evaluation forums used
   by students in our courses. As an example, a subject focused on the
   configuration of network services has been chosen to implement our
   approach. Our proposal will be able to graphically show the students'
   progress both in an experimental and collaborative way at the same time.
   Therefore, lecturers can guide each student through the learning process
   based on his/her particular knowledge-level and grade her/him at the end
   of the term. Some specific techniques are needed by the system, in our
   case Learning Analytics techniques are used, in order to observe the
   students' behavior and their level of proficiency. In particular, a set
   of evaluation events for each activity, the students' social network,
   the students' timeline for their activities and some relevant metrics
   associated to them are given.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) provide educators and students with
   a comprehensive snapshot of the learning domain. Visualizations
   showcasing student learning behavioral patterns can help students gain
   greater self-awareness of their learning progression, and at the same
   time assist educators in identifying those students who may be facing
   learning difficulties. While LADs have gained popularity, existing LADs
   are still far behind when it comes to employing predictive analytics
   into their designs. Our systematic literature review has revealed
   limitations in the utilization of predictive analytics tools among
   existing LADs. We find that studies leveraging predictive analytics only
   go as far as identifying the at-risk students and do not employ model
   interpretation or explainability capabilities. This limits the ability
   of LADs to offer data-driven prescriptive advice to students that can
   offer them guidance on appropriate learning adjustments. Further,
   published studies have mostly described LADs that are still at prototype
   stages; hence, robust evaluations of how LADs affect student outcomes
   have not yet been conducted. The evaluations until now are limited to
   LAD functionalities and usability rather than their effectiveness as a
   pedagogical treatment. We conclude by making recommendations for the
   design of advanced dashboards that more fully take advantage of machine
   learning technologies, while using suitable visualizations to project
   only relevant information. Finally, we stress the importance of
   developing dashboards that are ultimately evaluated for their
   effectiveness.},

   visualise feedback on learning activities using authentic data in
   real-time. The REFLECTOR project was used to investigate whether there
   are correlations between students learning strategies, their online
   activity and their grades. Information about the learning strategies was
   obtained using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. The
   grades and the online activity of students for two pilot courses was
   collected from the log data of the learning management system. Analysis
   of the collected data showed that there are moderate correlations to be
   found, for instance between metacognitive self-regulation, documents
   that are related to planning and grades. The pilot sessions taught us
   that there are practical issues with regards to data storage location as
   well as data security that need to be taken into account when learning
   analytics is integrated into existing learning designs. Overall, the
   project results show that a close relationship between learning
   analytics and the learning design of courses is urgently needed to make

Title = {Students' Perceptions of Generative AI-Powered Learning Analytics in the
   Feedback Process: A Feedback Literacy Perspective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {152-168},
Abstract = {This paper explores the integration of generative AI (GenAI) in the
   feedback process in higher education through a learning analytics (LA)
   tool, examined from a feedback literacy perspective. Feedback literacy
   refers to students' ability to understand, evaluate, and apply feedback
   effectively to improve their learning, which is crucial for fostering
   self-regulated learning and academic growth. GenAI has the potential to
   open new avenues of research and design in augmenting feedback practices
   by providing innovative, personalized, and scalable feedback solutions.
   The study investigates how GenAI functionalities, specifically ChatGPT
   explanation features and GenAI-powered dashboard visualizations, can
   support students in engaging with feedback. Using feedback literacy
   theory, a thematic analysis was conducted and triangulated with usage
   trace data to assess students' perceptions of these functionalities. The
   study involved three key activities: introductory lab sessions,
   in-semester use of the GenAI-powered LA feedback tool, and post hoc
   interviews, with data collected from 18 students from various
   disciplines (information technology, education, business and economics,
   and engineering) throughout all phases. Initial findings from the lab
   sessions showed positive perceptions of the GenAI functionalities.
   However, trace data from in-semester use indicated modest engagement
   with GenAI. Post hoc interviews revealed that reduced engagement was due
   to a mismatch between the GenAI outputs and student expectations. While
   some students appreciated the GenAI functionalities, others found them
   redundant when they perceived the feedback as clear and easy to
   understand. This study highlights the potential of GenAI in the feedback
   process and underscores the challenges of aligning AI tools with diverse
   student needs. Future developments should focus on creating adaptive and
   discipline-specific GenAI solutions.},

Abstract = {Even though the recent influx of tablets in primary education goes
   together with the vision that educational technology empowered with
   learning analytics will revolutionize education, empirical results
   supporting this claim are scares. Adaptive educational technology
   Snappet combines extracted and embedded learning analytics daily in
   classrooms. While students make exercises on the tablet this technology
   displays real-time data of learner performance in a teacher dashboard
   (extracted analytics). At the same time, learner performance is used to
   adaptively adjust exercises to students' progress (embedded analytics).
   This quasi-experimental study compares the development of students'
   arithmetic skills over one schoolyear (grade 2 and 4) in a traditional
   paper based setting to learning with the adaptive educational technology
   Snappet. The results indicate that students in the Snappet condition
   make significantly more progress on arithmetic skills in grade 4.
   Moreover, in this grade students with a high ability level, benefit the
   most from working with this adaptive educational technology. Overall the
   development pattern of students with different abilities was more
   divergent in the AET condition compared to the control condition. These
   results indicate that adaptive educational technologies combining
   extracted and embedded learning analytics are indeed creating new
   education scenarios that contribute to personalized learning in primary
   education.},

Abstract = {Teachers in a collaborative learning (CL) environment have the demanding
   task of monitoring several groups of students at the same time and
   intervening when needed. This withitness (both the situational awareness
   and interventions taken in class) of the teacher might be increased with
   the help of a guiding dashboard alerting the teacher of problems and
   providing suggestions for interventions. This paper introduces a
   quasi-experiment carried out in authentic classrooms. We examined how a
   mirroring and an alerting \& guiding dashboard affected the withitness
   of teachers in a face-to-face learning environment while students
   discussed and used a collaborative writing tool. Twenty-four teachers
   were observed, interviewed, and answered surveys in three different
   conditions altogether: with no extra information about the situation,
   using a dashboard mirroring low-level data about the collaboration, and
   additionally an AI assistant indicating problems in pedagogical terms
   and potential solutions (i.e., a guiding dashboard). The results show
   that the situational awareness of the teachers increased with the
   introduction of a mirroring dashboard. The workload of the participating
   teachers dropped more with the introduction of an alerting \& guiding
   dashboard, helping teachers feel less frustrated and more accomplished.},

Abstract = {Online courses enable wide access to educational resources and thus
   provide a feasible platform for cross-regional teacher professional
   learning. Learning analytics dashboards (LAD) can support online
   learners by providing fine-grained feedback generated from learners `
   interactions with platforms. Nevertheless, most studies on teacher
   online professional learning focus on resource-rich and
   technology-advanced regions, with scarce attention to the Global South.
   Furthermore, existing studies on LAD design mainly target students `
   learning, rather than teachers ` professional learning. Therefore, it is
   much needed to develop LAD for teacher-learners online professional
   learning in the Global South. Contextualized in an international online
   professional training initiative, this study conducted in-depth
   interviews with 42 teacher-learners from 19 countries in the Global
   South, aiming to identify their needs for 1) support on their
   self-regulated learning (SRL), and 2) potential LA components in
   dashboards. Findings indicated that teacher-learners needed support for
   self-regulated learning strategies, including motivation maintenance,
   time management, environment structuring, help-seeking, and
   self-evaluation. Nine LA features were identified to design the LADs to
   support SRL preliminarily. This co-designed LAD study with interviewees
   improved our understanding on the needs of college teachers in the
   Global South for LA support during their online professional learning,
   generating practical insights into needs-driven LAD designs.},

Abstract = {One of the difficulties experienced by online learners is the lack of
   regular supervision as well as the need to provide instructions to
   support the learning process more effectively. The analysis of the
   learning data in the online courses is not only becoming increasingly
   important in forecasting learning outcomes but also providing effective
   instructional strategies for learners to help them get the best results.
   In this paper, we propose a forecast learning outcomes model based on
   learners' interaction with online learning systems by providing learning
   analytics dashboard for both learners and teachers to monitor and orient
   online learners. This approach is mainly based on some machine learning
   and data mining techniques. This research aims to answer two research
   questions: (1) Is it possible to accurately predict learners' learning
   outcomes based on their interactive activities? (2) How to monitor and
   guide learners in an effective online learning environment? To answer
   these two questions, our model has been developed and tested by learners
   participating in the Moodle LMS system. The results show that 75\% of
   students have outcomes close to the predicted results with an accuracy
   of over 50\%. These positive results, though done on a small scale, can
   also be considered as suggestions for studies of using learning
   analytics in predicting learning outcomes of learners through learning
   activities.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we do education in recent
   years. In fact, thanks in part to the progress of the Internet, there
   has been an exponential growth in courses delivered in distance mode.
   Among these, Massive Open Online Courses are undoubtedly those courses
   where the growth in enrolments has been strongest: in fact, even in
   universities there are distance courses with thousands of enrolments. In
   this scenario, it is really difficult, if not impossible, for a teacher
   to monitor the learning process of her/his class, unless he or she is
   equipped with one or more tools enabling him or her to follow the
   students, in their learning process, in a more analytical manner. In
   this paper we propose a web tool, the AI4T system, a dashboard usable as
   a web application, which allows the teacher, once an assignment has been
   assigned to her/his students, to monitor their outcomes through a
   representation in a two-dimensional space. We present an initial
   experiment with encouraging results.},

Abstract = {There is a proliferation of learning analytics (LA) dashboards aimed at
   supporting teachers. Yet, teachers still find it challenging to make
   sense of LA dashboards, thereby making informed decisions. Two main
   strategies to address this are emerging: i) upskilling teachers' data
   literacy; ii) improving the explanatory design features of current
   dashboards (e.g., adding visual cues or text) to minimise the skills
   required by teachers to effectively use dashboards. While each approach
   has its own trade-offs, no previous work has explored the interplay
   between the dashboard design and such ``data skills{''}. In this paper,
   we explore how teachers with varying visualisation literacy (VL) skills
   use LA dashboards enhanced with (explanatory) data storytelling
   elements. We conducted a quasi-experimental study with 23 teachers of
   varied VL inspecting two versions of an authentic multichannel dashboard
   enhanced with data storytelling elements. We used an eye-tracking device
   while teachers inspected the students' data captured from Zoom and
   Google Docs, followed by interviews. Results suggest that high VL
   teachers adopted complex exploratory strategies and were more sensitive
   to subtle inconsistencies in the design; while low VL teachers benefited
   the most from more explicit data storytelling guidance such as
   accompanying complex graphs with narrative and semantic colour encoding.},

Abstract = {Purpose The aims of this study are to examine affective responses of
   university students when viewing their own predictive learning analytics
   (PLA) dashboards, and to analyse how those responses are perceived to
   affect their self-regulated learning behaviour.
   Design/methodology/approach A total of 42 Northern Irish students were
   shown their own predicted status of academic achievement on a dashboard.
   A list of emotions along with definitions was provided and the
   respondents were instructed to verbalise them during the experience.
   Post-hoc walk-through conversations with participants further clarified
   their responses. Content analysis methods were used to categorise
   response patterns. Findings There is a significant variation in ways
   students respond to the predictions: they were curious and motivated,
   comforted and sceptical, confused and fearful and not interested and
   doubting the accuracy of predictions. The authors show that not all
   PLA-triggered affective states motivate students to act in desirable and
   productive ways. Research limitations/implications This small-scale
   exploratory study was conducted in one higher education institution with
   a relatively small sample of students in one discipline. In addition to
   the many different categories of students included in the study,
   specific efforts were made to include ``at-risk{''} students. However,
   none responded. A larger sample from a multi-disciplinary background
   that includes those who are categorised as ``at-risk{''} could further
   enhance the understanding. Practical implications The authors provide
   mixed evidence for students' openness to learn from predictive learning
   analytics scores. The implications of our study are not straightforward,
   except to proceed with caution, valuing benefits while ensuring that
   students' emotional well-being is protected through a mindful
   implementation of PLA systems. Social implications Understanding
   students' affect responses contributes to the quality of student support
   in higher education institutions. In the current era on online learning
   and increasing adaptation to living and learning online, the findings
   allow for the development of appropriate strategies for implementing
   affect-aware predictive learning analytics (PLA) systems.
   Originality/value The current study is unique in its research context,
   and in its examination of immediate affective states experienced by
   students who viewed their predicted scores, based on their own dynamic
   learning data, in their home institution. It brings out the complexities
   involved in implementing student-facing PLA dashboards in higher
   education institutions.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Learning Analytics (LA) has become a very heterogeneous
   research field due to the diversity in the data generated by the
   Learning Management Systems (LMS) as well as the researchers in a
   variety of disciplines, who analyze this data from a range of
   perspectives. In this paper, we present the evaluation of a LA tool that
   helps course designers, teachers, students and educational researchers
   to make informed decisions about the selection of learning activities
   and LA indicators for their course design or LA dashboard. The aim of
   this paper is to present Open Learning Analytics Indicator Repository
   (OpenLAIR) and provide a first evaluation with key stakeholders (N=41).
   Moreover, it presents the results of the prevalence of indicators that
   have been used over the past ten years in LA. Our results show that
   OpenLAIR can support course designers in designing LA-based learning
   activities and courses. Furthermore, we found a significant difference
   between the relevance and usage of LA indicators between educators and
   learners. The top rated LA indicators by researchers and educators were
   not perceived as equally important from students' perspectives.},

Title = {Leveraging cultural forms in human-centred learning analytics design},

Abstract = {In this article, we offer theory-grounded narratives of a 4-year
   participatory design process of a Learning Analytics tool with K-12
   educators. We describe how we design-in-partnership by leveraging
   educators' routines, values and cultural representations into the
   designs of digital dashboards. We make our long-term reasoning visible
   by reflecting upon how design decisions were made, discussing key
   tensions and analysing to what extent the developed tools were taken up
   in practice. Through thick design narratives, we reflect upon how
   cultural forms-recognizable cultural constructs that might cue and
   facilitate specific activities-were identified among educators and
   informed the design of a dashboard. We then examined the extent to which
   the designed tool supported coaches and teachers to engage in Generative
   Uncertainty, an interpretive stance in which educators manifest
   productive inquiries towards data. Our analysis highlights that attuning
   to cultural forms is a valuable first step but not enough towards
   designing LA tools for systems in ways that fit institutionalized
   practices, challenge instrumental uses and spur productive inquiry. We
   conclude by offering two key criteria for making culturally-grounded
   design decisions in the context of long-term partnerships.Practitioner
   notesWhat is already known about this topicParticipatory design can
   invite stakeholders to directly inform the creation of LA artefacts that
   fit their needs, context and cultural markers.What this paper
   addsCultural forms can be identified and leveraged in the design of LA
   tools.HCLA scholars ought to design for systems-the complex body of
   organizational routines, cultural practices and interactions among
   multiple stakeholders-and not just for users.Implications for practice
   and/or policyLeveraging cultural forms in LA needs to be accompanied by
   a critical view of which practices, behaviours, values and structures
   are suggested by such forms.Designing features that are easy to use, are
   associated with concrete tasks, and fit into existing cultural practices
   are three criteria for embedding cultural forms into LA design.},

Abstract = {Dashboards are increasingly used in education to provide teachers and
   students with insights into learning. Yet, existing dashboards are often
   criticised for their failure to provide the contextual information or
   explanations necessary to help students interpret these data. Data
   Storytelling (DS) is emerging as an alternative way to communicate
   insights providing guidance and context to facilitate students'
   interpretations. However, while data stories have proven effective in
   prompting students' reflections, to date, it has been necessary for
   researchers to craft the stories rather than enabling teachers to do
   this by themselves. This can make this approach more feasible and
   scalable while also respecting teachers' agency. Based on the notion of
   DS, this paper presents a DS editor for teachers. A study was conducted
   in two universities to examine whether the editor could enable teachers
   to create stories adapted to their learning designs. Results showed that
   teachers appreciated how the tool enabled them to contextualise
   automated feedback to their teaching needs, generating data stories to
   support student reflection.},

Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {This paper presents a bibliometric systematic review on model-based
   learning analytics (MbLA), which enable coupling between teachers and
   intelligent systems to support the learning process. This is achieved
   through systems that make their models of student learning and
   instruction transparent to teachers. We use bibliometric network
   analysis and topic modelling to explore the synergies between the
   related research groups and the main research topics considered in the
   42 reviewed papers. Network analysis depicts an early stage community,
   made up of several research groups, mainly from the fields of learning
   analytics and intelligent tutoring systems, which have had little
   explicit and implicit collaboration but do share a common core
   literature. Th resulting topics from the topic modelling can be grouped
   into the ones related to teacher practices, such as awareness and
   reflection, learning orchestration, or assessment frameworks, and the
   ones related to the technology used to open up the models to teachers,
   such as dashboards or adaptive learning architectures. Moreover, results
   show that research in MbLA has taken an individualistic approach to
   student learning and instruction, neglecting social aspects and elements
   of collaborative learning. To advance research in MbLA, future research
   should focus on hybrid teacher-AI approaches that foster the partnership
   between teachers and technology to support the learning process, involve
   teachers in the development cycle from an early stage, and follow an
   interdisciplinary approach.},

Abstract = {This paper reports on usage and impact on learning achievements of a
   dashboard developed to help monitor self-regulated learning behaviours
   in an online professional development path. The design of the path as
   well as of the dashboard were grounded on a pre-existing conceptual
   framework distinguishing between four different types of self-regulated
   learning behaviours taking place in professional learning networks and
   underpinning professional practice sharing. One of the objectives of the
   path was to promote such behaviours among participants, and the
   dashboard was designed to support their self-monitoring. Data were
   collected through usage log files analysis, a survey, and pretest and
   posttest. The results shed light on participants' actual usage of the
   dashboard, their opinion regarding its usefulness in relation of its
   capability to measure and support their SRL processes, and the
   dashboard's actual impact on their learning achievements. Moreover, some
   limitations in the current configuration of the dashboard emerged, which
   can guide further development.},

Abstract = {This paper presents LISSA ({''}Learning dashboard for Insights and

   designed, developed, and evaluated in collaboration with study advisers.
   The overall objective is to facilitate communication between study
   advisers and students by visualizing grade data that is commonly
   available in any institution. More specifically, the dashboard attempts
   to support the dialogue between adviser and student through an overview
   of study progress, peer comparison, and by triggering insights based on
   facts as a starting point for discussion and argumentation. We report on
   the iterative design process and evaluation results of a deployment in
   97 advising sessions. We have found that the dashboard supports the
   current adviser-student dialogue, helps them motivate students, triggers
   conversation, and provides tools to add personalization, depth, and
   nuance to the advising session. It provides insights at a factual,
   interpretative, and reflective level and allows both adviser and student
   to take an active role during the session.},

Title = {Investigating the Effect of Visualization Literacy and Guidance on
   Teachers' Dashboard Interpretation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Recent research on learning analytics dashboards has focused on
   designing user interfaces that offer various forms of visualization
   guidance (often referring to notions such as data storytelling or
   narrative visualization) to teachers (e.g., emphasizing data points or
   trends with colour and adding annotations), aiding them in interpreting
   visual elements to gain a comprehensive understanding of students'
   learning processes. Yet, while some studies have explored how teachers
   interpret students' data through these dashboards, many have overlooked
   the diverse technical capabilities of teachers, which can significantly
   impact their use of LA dashboards. In particular, visualization literacy
   (VL) skills can greatly influence how effectively teachers interpret
   dashboards. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive account
   exists that details how teachers with varying VL skills interpret visual
   representations of students' data. In this paper, we address this gap by
   investigating how teachers interpret LA dashboards, both with and
   without visualization guidance, taking into account their VL. We
   illustrate this by analyzing teachers' think-aloud sessions as they
   engage with dashboards in the context of monitoring synchronous online
   learning tasks undertaken by student groups using Zoom and Google Docs.
   Using epistemic network analysis, we examine the differences in
   interpretations between teachers with varying VL levels. Our findings
   revealed that teachers with low VL exhibited shallower dashboard
   interpretations than those with high VL. However, the association of VL
   with successful task completion rate was not significant. Also,
   visualization guidance did not enable teachers to deepen their
   interpretations. While some visualization guidance helped teachers to
   complete tasks correctly, excessive visualization guidance can also be
   detrimental.},

Abstract = {Despite the success of academic advising dashboards in several higher
   educational institutions (HEI), these dashboards are still
   under-explored in Latin American HEI's. To close this gap, three
   different Latin American universities adapted an existing advising
   dashboard, originally deployed at the KU Leuven to their own context. In
   all three cases, the context was the main ruling factor to these
   adaptations. In this paper, we describe these adaptions using a
   framework that focuses on four different elements of the context:
   Objectives, Stakeholders, Key moment and Interactions. Evaluation of the
   adapted dashboards in the three different Latin American universities is
   conducted through pilots. This evaluation shows the value of the
   dashboard approach in different contexts in terms of satisfaction,
   usefulness and impact in academic decision-making and advising tasks.
   The main contribution of this paper is the systematic reporting of the
   adaptations to an academic advising dashboard and showing the value of
   an academic advising dashboard on academic decision-making and advising
   tasks.},

Abstract = {Applying games in education provides multiple benefits clearly visible
   in entertainment games: their engaging, goal-oriented nature encourages
   students to improve while they play. Educational games, also known as
   Serious Games (SGs) are video games designed with a main purpose other
   than pure entertainment; their main purpose may be to teach, to change
   an attitude or behavior, or to create awareness of a certain issue. As
   educators and game developers, the validity and effectiveness of these
   games towards their defined educational purposes needs to be both
   measurable and measured. Fortunately, the highly interactive nature of
   games makes the application of Learning Analytics (LA) perfect to
   capture students' interaction data with the purpose of better
   understanding or improving the learning process. However, there is a
   lack of widely adopted standards to communicate information between
   games and their tracking modules. Game Learning Analytics (GLA) combines
   the educational goals of LA with technologies that are commonplace in
   Game Analytics (GA), and also suffers from a lack of standards adoption
   that would facilitate its use across different SGs. In this paper, we
   describe two key steps towards the systematization of GLA: 1), the use
   of a newly-proposed standard tracking model to exchange information
   between the SG and the analytics platform, allowing reusable tracker
   components to be developed for each game engine or development platform;
   and 2), the use of standardized analysis and visualization assets to
   provide general but useful information for any SG that sends its data in
   the aforementioned format. These analysis and visualizations can be
   further customized and adapted for particular games when needed. We
   examine the use of this complete standard model in the GLA system
   currently under development for use in two EU H2020 SG projects.},

Abstract = {With the rising complexity of technology and its introduction into
   educational settings, the question of trusting and designing trustworthy
   learning analytics (LA) systems has gained importance. Transparency is
   one of the values that can contribute to enhancing an LA system's
   trustworthiness. It has been included and discussed as a separate core
   value or principle in many ethical frameworks for LA. Even though these
   frameworks provide valuable contributions, they are mostly limited to
   the conceptual level. Defining what transparency entails in the context
   of LA is an important aspect, nevertheless, the translation and
   operationalisation of such abstract concepts into technology should be
   equally considered.
   In this paper, we focus on the question of how transparency can be
   translated into concrete design requirements in order to enhance the
   trustworthiness of LA systems. We present a normative framework in the
   form of an interdisciplinary Criteria Catalogue for trustworthy LA,
   which consists of seven core areas, including transparency. Second, we
   demonstrate how transparency can be translated and operationalised into
   more specific and low-level elements by using an example of the
   Learners' Corner LA dashboard developed within the project ``Learning
   Analytics - Students in Focus{''}. Third, we share the results of a
   study conducted to better understand students' information needs in
   relation to LA tools and evaluate our design choices for the
   introduction of three quick information buttons within the Learners'
   Corner.},

   We conducted a quasi-experimental classroom study with 5 middle school

   plans they prepare, which then guides what teachers cover in a class

   with the ways that data displays undermined their existing pedagogical
   strategies. They were stymied by a lack of clarity on how data is
   assembled and imbued with meaning, which limited their own sensemaking
   about the data. They also expressed concerns about how the dashboards
   facilitated data collection about their instructional planning and

Abstract = {Laboratory experimentation is one of key elements of higher scientific
   education. Remote Intelligent Access to Labs in Higher Education
   (RIALHE) is an ambitious project involving three European partners aimed
   at promoting online access to state-of-the-art laboratory simulations
   and their environments. As part of the initiative to facilitate remote
   lab access, researchers and instructors require insights into the
   students attending these labs. This paper presents the co-design process
   for developing a low-fidelity instructor dashboard for remote labs in
   higher education, aiming to support the pedagogical design of labs and
   enhance student engagement and understanding in higher education
   laboratory experimentation. Our design journey is documented within the
   LATUX framework for co-designs from the field of learning analytics.
   Challenges encountered throughout the co-design principles are
   discussed, along with considerations for future directions.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},

Abstract = {Learning analytics enable automated feedback to students through
   dashboards, reports and alerts. The underlying untested assumption is
   that providing analytics will be sufficient to improve self-regulated
   learning. Working within a feedback recipience framework, we begin to
   test this assumption by examining the impact of learning analytics
   messages on student affect and academic resilience. Three hundred and
   twenty undergraduate students completed an online survey and were
   exposed to three randomly assigned learning analytics alerts (High
   Distinction, Pass, and Fail grades). Multivariate analyses of variance
   indicated significant differences between grade levels (large effects),
   with higher positive affect and lower resilience in response to High
   Distinction alerts than Pass or Fail alerts. Within each hypothetical
   grade level, there were no differences in student affect and academic
   resilience. Based upon systematic changes in feedback sender, message
   style or whether comparative peer achievement was included or not. These
   findings indicate that grade level has the largest impact on both affect
   and academic resilience. The failure of message and sender
   characteristics to impact on activities that promote self-regulated
   learning suggests we need to look beyond these characteristics of
   individual messages to identify drivers of engaging students in
   self-regulated learning.},

Title = {From awareness to empowerment: self-determination theory-informed
   learning analytics dashboards to enhance student engagement in
   asynchronous online courses},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 NOV 25},
Abstract = {Although learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are being recognized as
   tools that can enhance engagement-a crucial factor for the success of
   asynchronous online higher education-their impact may be limited without
   a solid theoretical basis for motivation. Furthermore, the processes
   through which students make decisions using dashboards and engage are
   not well understood. This study aimed to design a LAD informed by
   self-determination theory and to investigate university students'
   experiences with it. The findings, including those from stimulated
   recall interviews using eye-tracking data, shed light on how the LAD
   fosters student engagement. Interacting with the LAD fulfilled students'
   basic psychological needs. Awareness and reflection on learning status
   facilitated by the LAD boosted enthusiasm for active learning
   participation. The LAD offered essential information to support
   autonomous, strategic decisions, empowering students to take proactive
   actions toward personal goals while reinforcing their belief in
   achieving them. Despite its potential benefits, various improvements
   have been identified to further enhance its effectiveness. Based on the
   findings, we discuss the implications of this study for future research

Title = {Learning analytics for student homework activities during a long break:
   Evidence from K-12 education in Japan},
Journal = {RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) is an emergent field that aims to better
   understand students and provide intelligence to learners, teachers, and
   administrators using learning log data. Although the use of technology
   in class is increasing in the K-12 sector and tertiary education, cases
   of effective implementation of LA in secondary schools have rarely been
   reported. This study offers an example of LA implemented in a junior
   high Math class during long vacations in Japan. This paper comprises two
   studies: first, we analyzed 121 students' answer logs and their exam
   performance after vacation by the K-means clustering method. We found
   that students' progress patterns were categorized into four types of
   engagement-early, late, high, and low-and the early and high-engagement
   groups obtained significantly higher scores than the low-engagement
   group. In the second study, we implemented a real -time dashboard that
   visualizes students' progress patterns and gives students insights about
   their progress during the vacation period. We found that the dashboard
   significantly increased students' interactions with the assignment, and
   the questionnaire survey determined that the LA dashboard motivated
   students to learn during the long vacation period. Considering the
   previous studies of LA, we estimate that LA-based interventions enhance
   students' self-regulation skills, which is crucial for learning during
   long vacation periods. Our study offers a novel approach to implementing
   LA in K-12 education.},

Abstract = {Teaching demands educators adapt and improvise their instruction for
   each student's unique needs and capabilities across contexts. This
   requires teachers to observe their students, evaluate their ongoing
   learning, and offer individualized scaffolding and feedback and foster
   sustained growth and development. This challenging practice has been
   made even more difficult by the recent emphasis on data-driven
   instructional decision making from dashboards, further requiring
   teachers to become both pedagogical and data experts. Despite the
   development of dashboards to alleviate some of the load of collecting
   and aggregating complex multimodal student data, there is a need to
   provide support for teachers in analyzing, interpreting, and applying
   their students' real-time multimodal learning analytical data (e.g.,
   metacognitive accuracy, negative emotions) in the form of pedagogical
   companions. Before we can begin the design and development of these
   agents, we must first understand how educators are currently approaching
   multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) that report on more than just
   performance-based outcomes. In this on-going work, we begin by briefly
   reviewing MMLA in teacher dashboards, teacher data literacy, and the
   role of pedagogical companions in teacher augmentation technologies. We
   then describe the development of an in-progress study exploring how
   three teachers currently use fictious MMLA on self-regulated learning
   (SRL) processes and the emerging trends we see from their data. Finally,
   we postulate what these results suggest about the needs that embedded
   intelligent pedagogical companions may fill in future dashboard and
   agent design.},

Abstract = {Universities have increasingly emphasized competencies as central
   elements of students' development. However, the assessment of these
   competencies is not an easy task. The availability of data that learners
   generate in computer mediated learning offers great potential to study
   how learning takes place, and thus, to gather evidences for competency
   assessment using enriched rubrics. These are the so-called electronic
   assessment instruments. Among them, the enriched rubrics arises as a
   tool to improve the assessment process. However, the lack of data
   interoperability and the decentralization of those educational
   applications set out a challenge to exploit trace data. To face these
   problems we have designed and developed SCALA (Supporting Competency
   Assessment through a Learning Analytics approach), an analytics system
   that integrates usage-how the user interacts with resources- and
   social-how students and teachers interact among them- trace data to
   support competency assessment. After presenting the components of SCALA
   (process, model and platform), we evaluate them presenting six scenarios
   to know whether it is viable in terms of time, sustainability and
   quality assurance to normalize the heterogeneous data present in
   technology-rich learning environments. The results show and confirm the
   viability of the proposed solution and the possibility to offer
   real-time feedback to the teachers to assess students'.},

Abstract = {BackgroundWith increased use of artificial intelligence in the
   classroom, there is now a need to better understand the complementarity
   of intelligent learning technology and teachers to produce effective
   instruction. ObjectiveThe paper reviews the current research on
   intelligent learning technology designed to make models of student
   learning and instruction transparent to teachers, an area we call
   model-based learning analytics. We intended to gain an insight into the
   coupling between the knowledge models that underpin the intelligent
   system and the knowledge used by teachers in their classroom decision
   making. MethodsUsing a systematic literature review methodology, we
   first identified 42 papers, mainly from the domain of intelligent
   tutoring systems and learning analytics dashboards that conformed to our
   selection criteria. We then qualitatively analysed the context in which
   the systems were applied, models they used and benefits reported for
   teachers and learners. Results and ConclusionsA majority of papers used
   either domain or learner models, suggesting that instructional decisions
   are mostly left to teachers. Compared to previous reviews, our set of
   papers appeared to have a stronger focus on providing teachers with
   theory-driven insights and instructional decisions. This suggests that
   model-based learning analytics can address some of the shortcomings of
   the field, like meaningfulness and actionability of learning analytics
   tools. However, impact in the classroom still needs further research, as
   in half of the cases the reported benefits were not backed with
   evidence. Future research should focus on the dynamic interaction
   between teachers and technology and how learning analytics has an impact
   on learning and decision making by teachers and students. We offer a
   taxonomy of knowledge models that can serve as a starting point for
   designing such interaction.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of technology has meant that over the past two
   decades Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) become
   increasingly involved in the teaching process and seek to change
   traditional learning models. With the support of modern technology,
   virtual platforms that encourage the adoption of a new learning paradigm
   in which geographical/temporal limitations no longer pose a difficulty
   have been developed and refined. These virtual learning platforms, also
   known as Learning Management Systems (LMS), store student and teacher
   interactions with course resources, and these interactions are stored in
   database engines. However, all the information generated by LMS has not
   been processed in a way that is helpful for the use of teachers and
   students, mainly because in most cases, students' interactions with
   these systems focus on downloading class material, delivering
   assignments, and reading announcements, leaving aside indicators that
   can be presented in the form of visualizations that allow actions to be
   taken during the development of the learning process. Thus, this study
   proposes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a dashboard for
   the analysis of learner behavior and prediction of dropout on the Moodle
   platform. The proposed tool will help students to manage their learning
   process, easily and effectively monitor their progress in an online
   course, and teachers to know what students do before, during and after a
   virtual class. The latter for the purpose of being able to detect early
   students at risk of dropping out.},

Abstract = {Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) help students learn but often are
   not designed to support teachers and their practices. A dashboard with
   analytics about students' learning processes might help in this regard.
   However, little research has investigated how dashboards influence
   teacher practices in the classroom and whether they can help improve
   student learning. In this paper, we explore how Luna, a dashboard
   prototype designed for an ITS and used with real data, affects teachers
   and students. Results from a quasi-experimental classroom study with 5
   middle school teachers and 17 classes show that Luna influences what
   teachers know about their students' learning in the ITS and that the
   teachers' updated knowledge affects the lesson plan they prepare, which
   in turn guides what they cover in a class session. Results did not
   confirm that Luna increased student learning. In summary, even though
   teachers generally know their classes well, a dashboard with analytics
   from an ITS can still enhance their knowledge about their students and
   support their classroom practices. The teachers tended to focus
   primarily on dashboard information about the challenges their students
   were experiencing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   that demonstrates that a dashboard for an ITS can affect teacher
   knowledge, decision-making and actions in the classroom.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) dashboards aggregate indicators about student
   performance and demographics to support academic advising. The majority
   of existing dashboards are targeted at advisors and professors, but not
   much attention has been put into students' need for information for
   their own academic decision-making. In this study, we identify relevant
   indicators from a student perspective using a mixed methods approach.
   Qualitative data was obtained from an open-ended online questionnaire
   answered by 31 student representatives, and quantitative data was
   collected from a closed-ended online questionnaire answered by 652
   students from different cohorts. Findings point out relevant indicators
   to help students choose what courses to take in an upcoming academic
   period. Since this study is part of a large research project that has
   motivated the adoption of academic advising dashboards in different
   Latin American universities, these findings were also contrasted with
   indicators of these advising dashboards, informing future developments
   targeting students.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of the
   state-of-the-art of research on learning dashboards in the fields of
   Learning Analytics and EducationalDataMining. Research on learning
   dashboards aims to identify what data ismeaningful to different
   stakeholders and how data can be presented to support sense-making
   processes. Learning dashboards are becoming popular due to the increased
   use of educational technologies, such as LearningManagement Systems
   (LMS) andMassive Open OnlineCourses (MOOCs). The initial search of
   fivemain academic databases and GScholar resulted in 346 papers out
   ofwhich 55 papers were included in the final analysis. Our review
   distinguishes different kinds of research studies aswell as various
   aspects of learning dashboards and theirmaturity regarding evaluation.
   As the research field is still relatively young, most studies are
   exploratory and proof-of-concept. The review concludes by offering a
   definition for learning dashboards and by outlining open issues and
   future lines ofwork in the area of learning dashboards. There is a need
   for longitudinal research in authentic settings and studies that
   systematically compare different dashboard designs.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present the SoftLearn Activity Reporter (SLAR) service

   show how textual reporting is a coherent way of providing information
   that can complement (and even enhance) visual statistics and help
   teachers to understand in a comprehensible manner the behavior of their
   students during the course. This solution extracts relevant information
   from the students' activity and encodes it into intermediate
   descriptions using linguistic variables and temporal references, which
   are subsequently translated into texts in natural language. The examples
   of application on real data from an undergraduate course supported by
   the SoftLearn platform show that automatic textual reporting is a
   valuable complementary tool for explaining teachers and learners the
   information comprised in a Learning Analytics Dashboard.},

   The presentation of learning data often takes place in the form of

   universities. Students, who are the primary data providers and at the
   same time the main users, should be involved in the process of
   developing Learning Analytics dashboards from the beginning. Since there
   are only a few guidelines for designing these dashboards in literature,
   we conducted a study with 139 business and information systems students
   who, in addition to answering a questionnaire, also designed their
   dashboards with the help of a case study. The dashboard analysis
   provides detailed insights into the design of the functional and

Abstract = {Compared to other platforms such as Coursera and EdX, FutureLearn is a
   relatively new player in the MOOC arena and received limited coverage in
   the Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining research. Founded by
   a partnership between the Open University in the UK, the BBC, The
   British Library and (originally) 12 universities in the UK, FutureLearn
   has two distinctive features relevant to the way their data is displayed
   and analyzed: 1) it was designed with a specific educational philosophy
   in mind which focuses on the social dimension of learning and 2) every
   learning activity provide opportunities for formal discussion and
   commenting. This workshop provides an opportunity to invite
   contributions and connect individual and groups to share their research
   activities on an international stage. As the first of its kind, this
   workshop will bring in a number of scholars and practitioners, as well
   as data scientists and analyst involved in the reporting, researching
   and developments emerging from the data offered by the platform.},

Abstract = {Interactive multimedia experiences (IME) can be a pedagogical resource
   that has a strong potential to enhance learning experiences in early
   childhood. Learning analytics (LA) has become an important tool that
   allows us to understand more clearly how these multimedia experiences
   can contribute to the learning processes of these students. This article
   proposes a work route that defines a set of activities and techniques,
   as well as a flow for their application, by taking into consideration
   the importance of including LA guidelines when designing IMEs for
   elementary education. The work route's graphical representation is
   inspired by the foundations of the Essence standard's graphical notation
   language. The guidelines are grouped into five categories, namely (i) a
   data analytics dashboard, (ii) student data, (iii) teacher data, (iv)
   learning activity data, and (v) student progress data. The guidelines
   were validated through two approaches. The first involved a case study,
   where the guidelines were applied to an IME called Coco Shapes, which
   was aimed at transition students at the Colegio La Fontaine in Cali
   (Colombia), and the second involved the judgments of experts who
   examined the usefulness and clarity of the guidelines. The results from
   these approaches allowed us to obtain precise and effective feedback
   regarding the hypothesis under study. Our findings provide promising
   evidence of the value of our guidelines, which were included in the
   design of an IME and contributed to the greater personalized monitoring
   available to teachers to evaluate student learning.},

Abstract = {A remote laboratory is a software and hardware tool which enables
   students to use real equipment -located in an educational
   institution-through the Internet. This way, students can experiment as
   if they were using the laboratories with their own hands. And, depending
   on the design, instructors can later see the results of these students.
   During the last decade, federation protocols to share remote
   laboratories have emerged. The focus of these protocols is to be make
   remote laboratories of one institution available in other in an
   automated manner, through institutional contracts. And these federation
   protocols usually rely on existing Remote Laboratory Management Systems
   (RLMS), which usually provide APIs for tracking student usage. At the
   same time, the interest on Learning Analytics is increasing. Learning
   Analytics focuses on the measurement and analysis of data about learners
   in their context. In the particular context of federated remote
   laboratories, new challenges arise: on the one hand, remote laboratories
   must be prepared to track insightful information from the student
   session so as to extract patterns, and on the other hand, the usage of a
   federated environment requires different degrees of anonymity. This
   contribution describes the new Learning Analytics dashboard of
   WebLab-Deusto, detailing what information can be extracted and how the
   usage of a RLMS simplifies the development of such tools in a federated
   environment.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a novel pedagogical approach to applying active
   reading (AR) strategies and the learning analytics dashboard to program
   comprehension (PC) in programming courses. The objective was to
   visualize the code-reading behaviors of novice programming learners
   using learning logs and promote code comprehension. The strategy was
   applied to students in computer science classes at a liberal arts
   college in India. The results show that the utilization of the dashboard
   positively influenced students' learning behaviors outside the
   classroom. It was recognized as an effective means of supporting PC,
   highlighting the need to elaborate on how to adopt dashboards in code
   reading tasks. The study confirms that reflecting on learning using the
   dashboard can promote learners' metacognitive skills, regardless of
   subject or language. It contributes to AR research by demonstrating new
   practical benefits of AR strategies for PC.},

Abstract = {Popular learning management systems (LMS) often feature dashboards
   displaying various analytics. This dashboard display might be suboptimal
   for some learning and development managers (L\&D). Moreover, the
   analytics presented are often based on standardised quizzes or
   semesters, which might be unsuitable (e. g., informal learning,
   corporate education, etc.). Finally, each LMS has its bespoke reporting
   solution, thus making it difficult for L\&D managers to monitor the
   situation across various LMSs. We propose an interactive system where an
   L\&D manager can customise the data source, queries, filters, and
   visualisations of their LMSs, and display them inline. To this end, we
   have built EVADE, a system that allows L\&D managers to capture data
   from various LMSs, analyse them, and embed related visualisations in
   each LMS. In this instance, we have integrated EVADE with a Moodle
   instance for corporate education, and Almanac, a tablet application for
   informal learning. In this paper we present EVADE and discuss how it can
   improve the L\&D manager-LMS interaction.},

   two courses, each with similar to 15 students and 1 instructor, for
   three months. We conducted semi-structured interviews to understand user

   Findings indicate benefits when systems contextualize creative work with
   assessment by integrating support for ideation with a learning analytics
   dashboard. Instructors are better able to track students and their work.
   Students are supported in reflecting on relationships among
   deliverables. We derive implications for contextualizing design with

Abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) have been developed as feedback
   tools to help students self-regulate their learning (SRL), using the
   large amounts of data generated by online learning platforms. Despite
   extensive research on LAD design, there remains a gap in understanding
   how learners make sense of information visualised on LADs and how they
   self-reflect using these tools. We address this gap through an
   experimental study where a LAD delivered personalised SRL feedback based
   on interactions and progress to a treatment group, and minimal feedback
   based on the average scores of the class to a control group. Following
   the feedback, students were asked to state in writing how they would
   change their study behaviour. Using a coding scheme covering learning
   strategies, metacognitive strategies and learning materials, three human
   coders coded 1,251 self-reflection texts submitted by 417 students at
   three time points. Our results show that learners who received
   personalised feedback intend to focus on different aspects of their
   learning in comparison to the learners who received minimal feedback and
   that the content of the dashboard influences how students formulate
   their self-reflection texts. Based on our findings, we outline areas
   where support is needed to improve learners' sense-making of feedback on
   LADs and self-reflection in the long term.},

Abstract = {In this study, an intervention engine based on learning analytics was
   designed and developed. The intervention engine is named the Intelligent
   Intervention System ((InS)-S-2). Within the scope of this research;
   (InS)-S-2 system and its components have been introduced, and the system
   is evaluated based on learners' views. (InS)-S-2 includes three types of
   intervention that are instructional, supportive, and motivational
   intervention. The instructional intervention was structured based on
   assessment tasks. The supportive and motivational interventions were
   structured based on the learning experiences of the learners. Signal
   lights (red, yellow, and green) are presented to the learners for each
   assessment task as an instructional intervention. Supportive
   intervention is presented to the learners via the dashboard. In the
   context of motivational intervention, elements of gamification as a
   leader board, badges, and notifications have been used. In order to
   obtain the learner's views about the (InS)-S-2, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with the learners who had a previous learning
   experience with the system. The learning environment was evaluated based
   on their views. Learners had a nine-week learning experience in the
   e-learning environment. Then, eight students who used the system most
   actively and eight students who used the system most passively were
   selected for focus group interviews.. According to the findings, it was
   seen that the learners who use the intervention engine indicated that
   the system is useful and want to use it in the context of other courses.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) offers new opportunities to enrich feedback

   different LA can enhance feedback practices for educators and students.
   This systematic literature review maps the current state of
   implementation of LA to improve feedback practices in
   technology-mediated learning environments in higher education. We used
   strict inclusion criteria to select relevant studies that have
   investigated the role of LA on feedback practices. To identify common
   features of LA for feedback studies, we coded relevant publications
   using an analytical framework that identifies four key dimensions of LA
   systems: what (types of data), how (analytic methods), why (objectives),
   and how educators and students are served by LA (stakeholders). Based on
   findings, we propose a conceptual framework that can guide the
   implementation of LA for feedback systems and also suggest future
   empirical research in this area.},

Abstract = {Monitoring and guiding multiple groups of students in face-to-face
   collaborative work is a demanding task which could possibly be
   alleviated with the use of a technological assistant in the form of
   learning analytics. However, it is still unclear whether teachers would
   indeed trust, understand, and use such analytics in their classroom
   practice and how they would interact with such an assistant. The present
   research aimed to find out what the perception of in-service secondary
   school teachers is when provided with a dashboard based on audio and
   digital trace data when monitoring a collaborative learning activity. In
   a vignette study, we presented twenty-one in-service teachers with
   videos from an authentic collaborative activity, together with
   visualizations of simple collaboration analytics of those activities.
   The teachers perceived the dashboards as providers of useful information
   for their everyday work. In addition to assisting in monitoring
   collaboration, the involved teachers imagined using it for picking out
   students in need, getting information about the individual contribution
   of each collaborator, or even as a basis for assessment. Our results
   highlight the need for guiding dashboards as only providing new
   information to teachers did not compel them to intervene and
   additionally, a guiding dashboard could possibly help less experienced
   teachers with data-informed assessment.},

Abstract = {Computer-assisted language learning (CALL) is often used as an approach
   to foreign language teaching and learning in higher education. The CALL
   course is offered at a national university in Japan to allow freshman
   students to perform self-regulated learning with e-learning materials
   for the purpose of developing language skills. However, as novice
   self-regulated learners, freshman students have low self-regulation
   skills and they are more likely to obtain lower achievement. In
   addition, it is difficult for instructors to grasp students' learning
   situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. Therefore, in this
   research, a total of 7,413,397 learning logs were analyzed, which were
   collected from 2,499 students' learning interactions in the CALL course.
   After that, a learning support system for freshman students is proposed.
   The system is provided for students and instructors through the learning
   dashboard. On the one hand, students can conduct self-monitoring and
   reflect their behaviors in a visual way. On the other hand, instructors
   can identify learning behavioral patterns and grasp individual learning
   situation to provide one-on-one instructions.},

Title = {Engaging online students through peer-comparison progress dashboards},

Abstract = {Purpose Students studying exclusively online face the challenge of
   gauging their progress in relation to that of their disparate peers. The
   purpose of this paper is to describe the creation of a student progress
   ``dashboard{''} in an online Masters programme, and the perceived
   effectiveness of the tool for engaging students.
   Design/methodology/approach Tableau (R) visualisation software was used
   to create a dashboard displaying cohort comparison data comprising
   metrics relating to the continuous assessment components of the Masters
   programme. An anonymous questionnaire gauged students' perceptions of
   the dashboard. Findings Feedback from students (n=137) suggests the
   dashboard improved their motivation, incentivising change in study
   behaviours, and sense of belonging to an online community of learners.
   It also acted as a conversation catalyst between staff and students,
   whereby students more readily engaged in dialogue with their personal
   tutor.
   Practical implications - Distance learners are more likely to feel
   isolated and can become demotivated, which contributes to typically
   higher levels of withdrawal from online programmes vs those delivered
   on-campus. Tutors may consider communicating progress data as dashboards
   to enable online students to monitor their academic progress alongside
   that of their peers, as a motivational tool in an otherwise disparate
   group of learners, and to reduce feelings of isolation by reminding
   distance learners that they are part of a larger online community.
   Originality/value This paper shares student and tutor perspectives on
   the use of dashboards to increase online students' motivation, and
   examines whether the benefits of a peer-comparison dashboard are
   reserved for high-achieving students.},

Abstract = {The interactive demo highlights LA-ReflecT, an LTI-enabled platform that
   facilitates the creation of micro-learning activities with multimedia
   content, and helps track interactions and artefacts created by students
   within the platform as xAPI logs. The platform facilitates reflection on
   action in the form of presenting information on a dashboard as a part of
   the learning activity. LA-ReflecT also enables an app connecting with
   Bluetooth sensors that stream time series signals. The sensor data from
   a user is synchronized with their particular activity and can be linked
   to their learning log. We are doing multiple pilots with research
   partners in Japan and India. We are open to discussing adaptors who want
   to potentially pilot LA-ReflecT for creating microlearning material and
   investigating the potential of the data logged in the platform.},

Abstract = {Emerging technological advancements can play an essential role in
   overcoming challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a promising
   educational technology field, Learning Analytics (LA) tools or systems
   can offer solutions to COVID-19 pandemic-related needs, obstacles, and
   expectations in higher education. In the current study, we
   systematically reviewed 20 papers to better understand the responses of
   LA tools to the online learning challenges that higher education
   students, instructors, and institutions faced during the pandemic. In
   addition, we attempted to provide key cases in which LA has been
   effectively deployed for various purposes during the pandemic in the
   higher education context. We found out several prominent challenges for
   stakeholders. Accordingly, learners needed of timely support and
   interaction, and experienced difficulty of time management. Instructors
   lacked pedagogical knowledge for online teaching. In particular,
   individual and collaborative assessment have been a challenge for them.
   Institutions have not been ready for a digital transformation and online
   teaching. In response to these challenges, LA tools have been deployed
   for the following opportunities: monitoring, planning online learning
   process, fostering learners' engagement and motivation, facilitating
   assessment process; increasing interaction, improving retention, being
   easy to use. Understanding these promises can also give insight into
   future higher education policies.},

Abstract = {Having a system to process and store information securely is crucial for
   an e-learning environment in a higher learning institute. Data recorded
   manually is deemed unsuitable as it may lead to mishandling of
   documents, poor record of documents movements, and even missing
   documents. A final year project (FYP) subject for a particular
   university's course would need a specific management system to alleviate
   the work processes of supervision and monitor student progress. This
   system would reduce cost, paperwork, staffing and even simplify the
   workflow process. Therefore, introducing a student dashboard-based
   system for the FYP course is proposed in this study. This paper presents
   a smart system utilizing data analytics and a dashboard that enables the
   students to self-monitor, track progress and manage important
   information related to their FYP. The system development followed
   stepwise Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology in developing
   the system. The developed system has been designed, developed, and
   tested by university students taking FYP courses. A Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM) was adopted in the testing phase to examine the
   system acceptance and user behavior intention in using the proposed
   system. The results showed a significant effect on a positive
   implementation in the faculty's course management and monitoring the
   student's FYP progress. For the dashboard-based system to reach its full
   potential, it is highly recommended to implement the system in its
   course management fully.},

Abstract = {Since the turn of the 21st century, we have seen a surge of studies on
   the state of U.S. education addressing issues such as cost, graduation
   rates, retention, achievement, engagement, and curricular outcomes.
   There is an expectation that graduates should be able to enter the
   workplace equipped to take on complex and ``messy{''} or ill-structured
   problems as part of their professional and everyday life. In the context
   of online learning, we have identified two key issues that are elusive
   (hard to capture and make visible): learning with ill-structured
   problems and the interaction of social and individual learning. We
   believe that the intersection between learning and analytics has the
   potential, in the long-term, to minimize the elusiveness of deep
   learning. A proposed analytics model is described in this article that
   is meant to capture and also support further development of a learner's
   reflective sensemaking.},

Abstract = {Learning analytic dashboards (LADs) have become more prevalent in higher
   education to help students, faculty, and staff make data-informed
   decisions. Despite extensive research on the design and usability of
   LADs, few studies have examined them in relation to issues of diversity,
   equity, and inclusion. We conducted a critical literature review to
   address three research questions: How does LAD research contribute to
   improving diversity, equity, and inclusion? How might LADs contribute to
   maintaining or exacerbating inequitable outcomes? And what future
   opportunities exist in this research space? Our review showed little use
   of LADs to address or improve issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion
   in the literature thus far. We argue that excluding these issues from
   LAD research is not an isolated oversight and it risks reinforcing
   existing inequities within the higher education system. We argue that
   LADs can be designed, researched, and deployed intentionally to advance
   equitable outcomes and help dismantle inequities in education. We
   highlight opportunities for future LAD research to address issues of
   diversity, equity, and inclusion.},

Title = {Explainable AI for Data-Driven Feedback and Intelligent Action
   Recommendations to Support Students Self-Regulation},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Abstract = {Formative feedback has long been recognised as an effective tool for
   student learning, and researchers have investigated the subject for
   decades. However, the actual implementation of formative feedback
   practices is associated with significant challenges because it is highly
   time-consuming for teachers to analyse students' behaviours and to
   formulate and deliver effective feedback and action recommendations to
   support students' regulation of learning. This paper proposes a novel
   approach that employs learning analytics techniques combined with
   explainable machine learning to provide automatic and intelligent
   feedback and action recommendations that support student's
   self-regulation in a data-driven manner, aiming to improve their
   performance in courses. Prior studies within the field of learning
   analytics have predicted students' performance and have used the
   prediction status as feedback without explaining the reasons behind the
   prediction. Our proposed method, which has been developed based on LMS
   data from a university course, extends this approach by explaining the
   root causes of the predictions and by automatically providing
   data-driven intelligent recommendations for action. Based on the
   proposed explainable machine learning-based approach, a dashboard that
   provides data-driven feedback and intelligent course action
   recommendations to students is developed, tested and evaluated. Based on
   such an evaluation, we identify and discuss the utility and limitations
   of the developed dashboard. According to the findings of the conducted
   evaluation, the dashboard improved students' learning outcomes, assisted
   them in self-regulation and had a positive effect on their motivation.},

Abstract = {Analytics about how students navigate online learning tools throughout
   the duration of an assignment is scarce. Knowledge about how students
   use online tools before a course's end could positively impact students'
   learning outcomes. We introduce PEDI (Piazza Explorer Dashboard for
   Intervention), a tool which analyzes and presents visualizations of
   forum activity on Piazza, a question and answer forum, to instructors.
   We outline the design principles and data-informed recommendations used
   to design PEDI. Our prior research revealed two critical periods in
   students' forum engagement over the duration of an assignment. Early
   engagement in the first half of an assignment duration positively
   correlates with class average performance. Whereas, extremely high
   engagement toward the deadline predicted lower class average
   performance. PEDI uses these findings to detect and flag troubling
   engagement levels and informs instructors through clear visualizations
   to promote data-informed interventions. By providing insights to
   instructors, PEDI may improve class performance and pave the way for a
   new generation of online tools.},

Abstract = {BackgroundUniversity students need to self-regulate but are sometimes
   incapable of doing so. Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) can support
   students' appraisal of study behaviour, from which goals can be set and
   performed. However, it is unclear how goal-setting and self-motivation
   within self-regulated learning elicits behaviour when using an
   LAD.ObjectivesThis study's purpose is exploring reference frames'
   influence on goal setting, LAD elements' influence on student
   motivation, and the predictive value of goal setting and motivation on
   behaviour, adding to our understanding of the factors predicting task
   attainment and the role of reference frames.MethodsIn an experimental
   survey design, university students (n = 88) used an LAD with a peer
   reference frame (Condition 1) or without one (Condition 2), set a goal,
   determined goal difficulty, self-assessed motivation and LAD elements'
   influence on motivation. Researchers coded goal specificity. Four weeks
   later, students self-assessed task attainment, task satisfaction, time
   on task, and task frequency. T-tests and MANOVA explored effects of the
   reference frame. Regression analyses determined predictive potential of
   goal difficulty, goal specificity, and motivation on goal
   attainment.Results and ConclusionsResults showed no difference between
   conditions on goal specificity, difficulty, or motivation. The peer
   reference frame's perceived influence on motivation was small. LAD
   elements' influence on motivation varied but were mainly positive.
   Regression models were not predictive, except the task satisfaction
   exploratory model. Most participants (77\%) attained their goals.
   Reference frame integration should be carefully considered, given
   potential negative effects. Students may require educators' support when
   setting goals, but the support should balance students' autonomy.},

Abstract = {It is known that teachers commonly utilize learning platforms equipped
   with Learning Analytics Dashboards (LAD) to support students in their
   Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) endeavors. However, students may struggle
   to effectively employ LAD due to a lack of sufficient metacognitive
   skills. Co-regulation of learning (CoRL) has been proven to facilitate
   metacognitive knowledge sharing. However, the implementation of LAD with
   CoRL mechanisms in self-paced, asynchronous learning environments, aimed
   at enhancing students' SRL, remains unclear. Investigating how students
   utilize a LAD with CoRL and how such a system can promote SRL in
   selfpaced, asynchronous courses is an important topic. This study
   designed a gamified LAD utilizing a futures trading market interactive
   interface as the CoRL mechanism. A quasi-experimental design was adopted
   to assess the effects of the gamified LAD with CoRL on SRL, learning
   engagement, and academic achievement among 60 students from two Business
   Ethics classes over the course of a semester. The gamified LAD with CoRL
   had positive effects on the SRL and learning engagement of the
   asynchronous learners in the experimental group. Significant differences
   were observed in the academic achievement of the experimental and
   control groups. The gamified LAD with CoRL had positive effects on
   learners in self-paced, asynchronous courses.},

Abstract = {Recent advancements in educational technology have enabled teachers to
   use learning analytics (LA) and flipped classrooms. The present study
   investigated the impact of a LA-based feedback system on students'
   academic achievement and self-regulated learning (SRL) in a flipped

   group quasi-experimental design with 71 preservice teachers in the
   experimental group and 56 pre-service teachers in the control group,
   both enrolled in an information technology course. The experimental
   group received LA-based feedback during a 4-week training program in the
   FL classroom, while the control group did not receive this feedback.
   Data were collected using an achievement test, an online SRL
   questionnaire, and a student opinion form. The study found that the
   students' SRL and academic achievement were not significantly affected
   by the LA-based feedback system in FL classrooms. In contrast, according
   to the qualitative research findings, students claimed the LA-based
   feedback helped them learn because it allowed them to monitor their
   learning processes.},

Abstract = {Every subject and course has a learning goal that we work towards during
   the teaching-learning process, whether it be online or offline. Under
   the current system, assignments, project analysis, semester exams, and
   internal exams are used to evaluate students' learning. Several factors,
   including participation in class, prior knowledge, engagement time,
   activity logs, forum posts, understanding level, etc., influence how
   well students learn throughout a course or session. All these factors
   will be difficult to analyze in offline mode. All of these activities
   determine whether or not the learning objective is met. This study
   examines an experiment that provided blended learning data on students'
   academic details, learning behaviors, and evaluation modules to
   determine the success of the two subjects. It discussed the details of
   each phase involved in the experiment. Students enrolled in integrated
   courses, MTech(PG-1) and MCA(PG-2) were analyzed in this study procedure
   through 4 weeks of offline classes. Moodle Gnomio was used for the
   online processes related to the Registration process, Quizzes, and
   discussion forums. A total of 6 quizzes for PG-1(M-Tech) and PG-2(MCA)
   were organized, and learning resources were provided before the exam.
   This study discusses detailed experiment setup, and Statistical analysis
   involving difficulty level of quizzes. This study proposed a framework
   for the dashboard that utilize this dataset and involves analysis
   related to student performance, grade distribution, inferring learning
   patterns, and course success.},

   them to better identify and support their child's individual learning
   needs. Evidence suggests that the PBS KIDS prototype LAP demonstrates
   potential for assessment and prediction of mathematics performance,
   including on the TEMA-3 standardized assessment for early mathematics.
   Similarly, early research findings suggest that the reporting

Abstract = {Self-directed learning (SDL) requires students to take initiative to
   learn and control their own learning process. Literature highlights the
   importance of SDL for lifelong learning. Yet, little understanding is
   known regarding how to support SDL at the school level, specifically for
   out-of-class learning context. To fill up this gap, this research
   developed a learning dashboard and integrated SDL process management in
   GOAL system. It was implemented to provide support for out-of-class
   online self-directed extensive reading (SDER) at a high school level. A
   two-group study conducted during a three-week spring vacation found the
   experimental group (N = 35, with SDL support) achieved significantly
   more reading outcomes than the control group (N = 12, without SDL
   support). Detailed GOAL interaction behavior analysis of the
   experimental group showed that viewing learning dashboard was
   significantly correlated with reading outcomes as well as interactions
   related to SDL process management. These findings highlights positive
   effect of SDL support in GOAL on students' out-of-class SDER outcomes as
   well as their SDL behaviors. The study provided implications for
   research related to extensive reading and SDL support for out-of-class

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards can provide students with personalized
   actionable feedback to enhance students' learning. Previous studies have
   shown positive effects of such advisory dashboards on course engagement
   and self-regulatory activities. To date, no studies have investigated
   the effects of advisory dashboards on students' offline learning
   activities, such as taking and reviewing written notes, while previous
   research suggests that many students also employ offline learning
   activities. Using a randomized control trial, the current study
   investigated the effects of an advisory dashboard on students' online
   and offline remediation activities. Before the start of a second-year
   course, 65 Bachelor of Law students completed a prior knowledge test
   concerning the topics of a preceding first-year course. The experimental
   group (n = 30) received their test results and personalized feedback to
   review particular knowledge clips and quizzes to remediate their prior
   knowledge. The control group (n = 35) received their test results and a
   generic, non-personalized remediation advice. A combination of digital
   trace and questionnaire data measured students' remediation activities,
   including the review of knowledge clips, online quizzes, readings and
   written notes. The findings did not reveal significant effects of the
   personalized actionable feedback on students' remediation activities.
   However, overall students showed a strong preference for offline
   activities to remediate their prior knowledge. This calls for further
   studies on students' offline learning activities in response to
   personalized actionable feedback.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are data visualization tools built
   to empower teachers and learners to make purposeful decisions that
   impact the learning process. Due to their relatively recent emergence
   and the scarcity of studies on their design principles, dashboard design
   remains a major area of investigation in learning analytics research,
   and large scale diffusion to their stakeholders remains limited. We
   promote human-centered approaches for LADs design since their success in
   terms of acceptance and adoption greatly depends on the level of
   stakeholder involvement in their design. In this paper, we present a
   tool to support the participatory design of LADs. First experiments
   during a pilot study with teachers demonstrate that the proposed tool
   encourages group work, and in-depth exploration of LADs use.},

Title = {The influence of task-value scaffolding in a predictive learning
   analytics dashboard on learners' statistics anxiety, motivation, and
   performance},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {173},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {There is an increasing trend of learning analytics dashboards (LADs)
   being used to provide feedback to learners. However, there is little
   empirical evidence about the influence of their design features on
   learners' cognitive and affective outcomes, especially in high-anxiety
   courses such as statistics. To address this gap, this study employed a
   two-group experimental design applied to an authentic setting to assess
   the influence of task-value scaffolding in a LAD on learners' anxiety,
   motivation, and learning performance in an online statistics course.
   This semester-long experiment was implemented in two instances of the
   course offering (Fall/2019 and Spring/2020) and involved a total of 146
   students. The results showed that task-value scaffolding had a negative
   impact on learners' computation anxiety and attitudes towards statistics
   in comparison to the control group. On the other hand, the treatment had
   no significant influence on other aspects of statistics anxiety,
   motivation, and learning outcomes. Taken jointly, these results suggest
   that the use of task-value scaffolding embedded in LADs can have
   detrimental effects on learners. More experimental studies are necessary
   to understand the positive and negative effects of LADs with
   motivational scaffolding.},

Title = {Artificial Intelligence Bringing Improvements to Adaptive Learning in
   Education: A Case Study},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Despite promising outcomes in higher education, the widespread adoption
   of learning analytics remains elusive in various educational settings,
   with primary and secondary schools displaying considerable reluctance to
   embrace these tools. This hesitancy poses a significant obstacle,
   particularly given the prevalence of educational technology and the
   abundance of data generated in these environments. In contrast to higher
   education institutions that readily integrate learning analytics tools
   into their educational governance, high schools often harbor skepticism
   regarding the tools' impact and returns. To overcome these challenges,
   this work aims to harness learning analytics to address critical areas,
   such as school dropout rates, the need to foster student collaboration,
   improving argumentation and writing skills, and the need to enhance
   computational thinking across all age groups. The goal is to empower
   teachers and decision makers with learning analytics tools that will
   equip them to identify learners in vulnerable or exceptional situations,
   enabling educational authorities to take suitable actions that are
   aligned with students' needs; this could potentially involve adapting
   learning processes and organizational structures to meet the needs of
   students. This work also seeks to evaluate the impact of such analytics
   tools on education within a multi-dimensional and scalable domain,
   ranging from individual learners to teachers and principals, and
   extending to broader governing bodies. The primary objective is
   articulated through the development of a user-friendly AI-based
   dashboard for learning. This prototype aims to provide robust support
   for teachers and principals who are dedicated to enhancing the education
   they provide within the intricate and multifaceted social domain of the
   school.},

Abstract = {The role of social media in higher education has shifted from providing
   a web 2.0 solution for supporting communication in computer supported
   learning to more advanced functionalities including virtual learning
   environment tools (e.g. content sharing, threaded discussions). This
   paper discusses how analysis of social media usage can equip tutors with
   visual probes to identify areas that may need attention. The paper also
   describes how data mining can be used to assess communication patterns
   in computer supported collaborative learning (e.g. issues associated
   with content, learning activities or student competencies).
   The data collected from Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn have been
   analysed using various statistical techniques to identify group
   cohesion, communication pattern, student interactions with and use of
   the different types of social media. Current work presented in the paper
   includes the statistical analysis of data communication between small
   student groups or student pairs from a cohort of more than 200 final
   year students studying information systems, over a two-year period. The
   scope of the analysis was to assess how different learning tasks
   affected individual and group contributions as well as the impact of
   specific learning activities on tasks such as commenting, sharing,
   linking and liking. The investigation also considered how keywords were
   used, indicating how social media interaction was affected by the
   subjects covered during specific learning weeks.
   Building on previous work by the authors, this paper tests metrics
   identified previously for use in a learning analytics dashboard. The
   data includes attributes, which identify students' usage of social media
   such as total tweets, Facebook posts and LinkedIn projects, submitted by
   students over a period of 24 learning weeks over 7-8 months, during the
   two academic years 2014-15 and 2015-16.
   Data mining techniques are used to investigate whether metric,
   identified before, are useful in predicting student's results in terms
   of engagement, involvement, participation, contribution and
   communication. These are some of the factors that may affect the
   learning experience when integrating Web 2.0 technologies with
   traditional virtual learning environments. Current work also discussed
   the design of learning dashboards, to identify student's results in real
   time (i.e. identifying those students who are likely to fail or need
   additional support), as ways to implement learning analytics in the
   curriculum.},

Abstract = {Educational technologies, such as teacher dashboards, are being
   developed to support teachers' instruction and students' learning.
   Specifically, dashboards support teachers in providing the just-in-time
   instruction needed by students in complex contexts such as science
   inquiry. In this study, we used the Inq-Blotter teacher-alerting
   dashboard to investigate whether teacher support elicited by the
   technology influenced students' inquiry performance in a science
   intelligent tutoring system, Inq-ITS. Results indicated that students'
   inquiry improved after receiving teachers' help, elicited by the
   Inq-Blotter alerts. This inquiry improvement was significantly greater
   than for matched students who did not receive help from the teacher in
   response to alerts. Epistemic network analyses were then used to
   investigate the patterns in the discursive supports provided to students
   by teachers. These analyses revealed significant differences in the
   types of support that fostered (versus did not foster) student
   improvement; differences across teachers were also found. Overall, this
   study used innovative tools and analyses to understand how teachers use
   this technological genre of alerting dashboards to dynamically support
   students in science inquiry.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {229},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Despite the ubiquitous use of learning analytics dashboards in
   computer-mediated learning environments, there is still a knowledge gap
   on how these tools can support learners' academic performance and
   motivation. This article describes an experimental study that
   investigated the influence of motivational prompts (task-value
   scaffolding) in a descriptive learning analytics dashboard on learners'
   motivation, statistics anxiety, and learning performance in an authentic
   semester-long online statistics course. The study was based on a
   two-group experimental design during two semesters (Fall 2020 and Spring
   2021). A total of 122 graduate students completed the study. The results
   showed that despite learners' mostly positive perceptions of the
   dashboard, the use of motivational prompts did not influence learners'
   cognitive outcomes. Test anxiety was the only affective outcome
   influenced by the intervention, with motivational prompts having a
   negative effect on learners who started the course with a higher level
   of test anxiety. This study provides needed empirical evidence on how
   the design of these tools can influence learners' affective outcomes,
   with implications for theory and practice. However, additional
   experimental studies that account for sources of heterogeneity (e.g.,
   intrapersonal characteristics, contextual factors) are necessary to
   uncover theoretical gaps and opportunities in the design of effective
   learning analytics dashboards.},

Abstract = {Effective written communication is an essential skill which promotes
   educational success for undergraduates. However, undergraduate students,
   especially those in their first year at university, are unused to this
   form of writing. After their long experience with the schoolroom essay,
   for most undergraduates academic writing development is painstakingly
   slow. Thus, especially those with poor writing abilities, should write
   more to be better writers. Yet, the biggest impediment to more writing
   is that overburdened tutors would ask limited number of drafts from
   their students. Today, there exist powerful computational language
   technologies that could evaluate student writing, saving time and
   providing timely, speedy, reliable feedback which can support educators
   marking process. This paper motivates an updated visual analytics

Abstract = {The enthusiasm for student-facing analytics as tools for supporting
   student self-regulation is overshadowed by uncertainties about their
   actual impact on student outcomes. This study aims to fill the gap in
   experimental evidence concerning student-facing analytics by
   implementing a randomized control trial. Specifically, we investigated
   the effects of data visualizations that display student level of content
   mastery in comparison to their peers, alongside recommendations for
   learning strategies. The preliminary results reveal that the
   intervention impacts student attribution and motivation in varying ways,
   based on their self-evaluation of their current course performance.
   Further analysis, including coding students' interpretation of the data
   visualization, will be conducted to uncover the diverse ways students
   might interpret the analytics.},

Abstract = {Learning dashboards are often used to provide teachers with insight into
   students' learning processes. However, simply providing teachers with
   data on students' learning processes is not necessarily beneficial for
   improving learning and teaching; the data need to be actionable.
   Recently, human-centered learning analytics has been suggested as a
   solution to realize more effective and actionable dashboards.
   Accordingly, this study aims to identify how these human-centered
   approaches could be used to design an interpretable and actionable
   learning dashboard on students' writing processes. The design consists
   of three iterative steps. First, visualizations on students' revision
   process, created from keystroke data, were evaluated with writing
   researchers. Second, the updated visualizations were used to co-design a
   paper prototype of the dashboard within a focus group session with
   writing teachers. Finally, the paper prototype was transformed into a
   digital prototype and evaluated by teachers in individual user test
   interviews. The results showed that this approach was useful for
   designing an interpretable dashboard with envisioned actions, which
   could be further tested in classroom settings.},

Abstract = {The fast development of software for medicine caused the arise of new
   methods of learning about illnesses and complications which appear
   during pregnancies. The curriculum has to adapt to the student's skills,
   knowledge for them to reach their potential. Learning analytics provides
   answers and possible solutions for the pregnant women who come to be
   monitored and treated. The measurement, gathering, analysis and
   reporting of biological parameters help the doctors and their students
   to understand and to optimize the healthcare learning, as well as to
   improve the applied treatments. The proposed tool combines descriptions,
   diagnostics, predictions and prescriptions in order to obtain optimal
   results. The online learning experiences bring evolution and expansion
   of knowledge for the medical students who will become the future
   generations of doctors. The system uses an ontology to build the learner
   profile regarding the notions about illnesses and complications of
   pregnant women. The recommender algorithm takes into consideration the
   medical students who did well while learning from the course where the
   mandatory notions have to be known. The mandatory notions that appear
   inside the ontology are defined in an RDF file. The notions are linked
   using RDF triples that are created between a subject, an object and a
   predicate. The information about the other consulted materials which are
   added by the doctors are also taken into consideration when doing the
   reading recommendations based on the new created triples. SPARQL queries
   are used for querying the data depending on the ontology reasoning and
   on the defined rules that satisfy a certain condition. The learning
   analytics software takes into consideration implicit and explicit
   metrics. The implicit metric gives the patterns of the user's behaviour,
   without being aware of it. The explicit metric is triggered by the
   notions which are checked based on validated knowledge coming from the
   medical staff. The quality of learning is improved by analyzing the
   described metrics and using the automatic recommender in a time where it
   is difficult to choose out of the many resources and courses that are
   available online. The dashboard of the students provides them
   information to understand the immediate actions which should be
   undertaken for studying pregnancy complications.},

Abstract = {While positive effects of imitating other learners have been reported,
   the recent increases in the number of online classes have seriously
   limited opportunities to learn how others are learning. Providing
   information about others' learning activities through dashboards could
   be a solution, but few studies have targeted learning activities on
   e-textbook systems; it remains unclear what information representations
   would be useful and how they would affect learning. We developed a
   dashboard system that enables live sharing of students' learning
   activities on e-textbooks. An experiment was conducted applying the
   dashboard in an online class to evaluate its impact. The results of
   questionnaires and quizzes were analyzed along with learning activities
   on the e-textbook system. From the questionnaire results, the most
   useful feedback types were identified. Regarding the impact on learning,
   the study found that a higher percentage of students who used the
   dashboard followed the progress of the class than those who did not. The
   study also found that students who used the dashboard were more likely
   to achieve higher quiz scores than those who did not. This study is the
   first to reveal what specific feedback is useful and to successfully
   investigate the impact of its use on learning.},

Abstract = {Easily accessible and interpretable performance data constitute critical
   feedback for learners that facilitate informed self-assessment and
   learning planning. To provide this feedback, there has been a
   proliferation of educational dashboards in recent years. An educational

Abstract = {The process of using analytic data to inform instructional
   decision-making is acknowledged to be complex; however, details of how
   it occurs in authentic teaching contexts have not been fully unpacked.
   This study investigated five university instructors' use of a learning
   analytics dashboard to inform their teaching. The existing literature
   was synthesized to create a template for inquiry that guided interviews,
   and inductive qualitative analysis was used to identify salient emergent
   themes in how instructors 1) asked questions, 2) interpreted data, 3)
   took action, and 4) checked impact. Findings showed that instructors did
   not always come to analytics use with specific questions, but rather
   with general areas of curiosity. Questions additionally emerged and were
   refined through interaction with the analytics. Data interpretation
   involved two distinct activities, often along with affective reactions
   to data: reading data to identify noteworthy patterns and explaining
   their importance in the course using contextual knowledge. Pedagogical
   responses to the analytics included whole-class scaffolding, targeted
   scaffolding, and revising course design, as well two new non-action
   responses: adopting a wait-and-see posture and engaging in deep
   reflection on pedagogy. Findings were synthesized into a model of
   instructor analytics use that offers useful categories of activities for

Title = {TABAT: DESIGN AND EXPERIMENTATION OF A LEARNING ANALYSIS DASHBOARD FOR
   TEACHERS AND LEARNERS},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {331-350},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries
   have adopted online education as an alternative to face-to-face courses.
   This has increased awareness of the importance of analyzing learning
   data left by students to improve and evaluate the learning process. This
   article presents a new tool, named TaBAT, created to work with different
   LMSs in the form of dashboards accessible online and allowing teachers
   to monitor the progress of their learners and at the same time allow
   learners to visualize their learning process.
   Background TaBAT is designed based on the results of our previous
   research on factors that can influence the success of online learners,
   where we proposed and statistically validated a model for assessing the
   success of online learners called e-LSAM (e-Learner Success Assessment
   Model).
   Methodology Two studies are presented in this article. The first one is
   conducted on a group of students from two classes (each composed of two
   groups) of a higher institute in Morocco, who participated in courses
   organized in blended learning on the Moodle platform. For each class,
   one of the two groups had access to the experiment to use the TaBAT tool
   (exposed group) to analyze the learning traces, while the second group
   did not have access to the dashboard (control group). The second study
   aimed to understand the impact of the usage of the TaBAT tool on the two
   exposed groups.
   Contribution The purpose of this article is to present a new analysis
   tool as well as to test this tool and to evaluate its impact on
   self-regulation and the prediction of academic success and, finally, to
   see how these students evaluate this tool.
   Findings The results of the TaBAT usage demonstrate the effectiveness of
   the success algorithm, based on our theoretical model e-LSAM. The
   results also prove that this tool was able to increase the performance
   of the students of both groups exposed. The general evaluations of the
   participants also confirmed these results.
   Impact on Society The article proposes a tool for institutions to
   facilitate the monitoring and control of students' learning process. The
   tool provides visual information for teachers to study and react to in
   the educational context and gives students visualizations to promote
   their self-reflection and increase their performance and academic
   success.
   Future Research Generalize the use of the TaBAT tool, incorporating both
   private and public institutions, in order to confirm the results
   obtained in this article and at the same time improve the
   self-regulation and academic success of learners.},

Title = {Making the Data Visible: A Systematic Review of Systems-Level Data
   Dashboards for Leadership and Policy in Education},
Journal = {REVIEW OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 DEC 6},
Abstract = {Systems-level data dashboards, those that provide education data
   aggregated to or used by leaders from school to state to federal levels,
   have become increasingly prevalent in the field of education both in the
   United States and in many education systems worldwide. This study
   provides a systematic review of the literature on systems-level data
   dashboards in K-12 schooling. The review demonstrates that research on
   systems-level dashboards lags that of student and teacher-focused
   learning analytics dashboards; that academic achievement remains the
   primary focus of dashboards, but contextual and non-test-score outcomes
   are now included in many dashboards and that use of dashboards by
   educators and the public is lower than desired but may be improved
   through alternative dissemination methods. It also demonstrates that
   research on the impacts of dashboards is particularly limited, a concern
   given the potential for unintended negative consequences. The article
   discusses the need to further incorporate systems-level dashboards into
   the organizational structures of education systems in order to enhance
   their utility for improving outcomes. The findings provide insights for
   stakeholders designing and using dashboards and hold the potential to
   improve dashboard use and student outcomes.},

Abstract = {Writing-to-Learn (WTL) is an evidence-based instructional practice which
   can help students construct knowledge across many disciplines. Though it
   is known to be an effective practice, many instructors do not implement
   WTL in their courses due to time constraints and inability to provide
   students with personalized feedback. One way to address this is to
   include peer review, which allows students to receive feedback on their
   writing and benefits them as they act as reviewers. To further ease the
   implementation of peer review and provide instructors with feedback on
   their students' work, we labeled students' peer review comments across
   courses for type of feedback provided and trained a machine learning
   model to automatically classify those comments, improving upon models
   reported in prior work. We then created a dashboard which takes
   students' comments, labels the comments using the model, and allows
   instructors to filter through their students' comments based on how the
   model labels the comments. This dashboard can be used by instructors to
   monitor the peer review collaborations occurring in their courses. The
   dashboard will allow them to efficiently use information provided by
   peers to identify common issues in their students' writing and better
   evaluate the quality of their students' peer review.},

Abstract = {Mature English Language Learners (ELLs) learning to write in informal
   environments have little access to instructor feedback and must rely on
   other sources to support their writing development. While it is known
   that mature ELLs trust instructor feedback, their perceptions towards
   feedback from non-expert sources may be mixed. We report on mature ELLs'
   perceptions and interpretations of peer and automated feedback when
   using dashboard visualizations of their writing skills derived from
   several metrics and sources of feedback. These perceptions and
   interpretations were collected through a short-term deployment of the
   dashboard within a writing app with 16 mature ELLs, followed by
   interviews with the learners. From analyses of these interviews, we
   suggest three design guidelines (DG) related to learning analytics
   dashboard design for mature ELLs in informal learning contexts. First,
   analytics-based feedback should contextualize ELLs' learning progress by
   providing temporal information about learner performance. Second,
   justifications should accompany feedback to avoid criticism arising from
   ELLs' prior beliefs. Third, learner autonomy should be fostered by
   offering explicit mechanisms for reflecting on feedback that is
   inconsistent with learner beliefs since learners are willing to question
   automated feedback. We discuss how these three guidelines can be used to
   benefit learners when an instructor is not present.},

Title = {A Sentence-Embedding-Based Dashboard to Support Teacher Analysis of
   Learner Concept Maps},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Concept mapping is a valuable method to represent a domain of knowledge,
   also with the aim of supporting educational needs. Students are called
   upon to construct their own knowledge through a meaningful learning
   process, linking new concepts to concepts they have already learned,
   i.e., connecting new knowledge to knowledge they already possess.
   Moreover, the particular graphic form of a concept map makes it easy for
   the teacher to construct and interpret both. Consequently, for an
   educator, the ability to assess concept maps offered by students,
   facilitated by an automated system, can prove invaluable. This becomes
   even more apparent in educational settings where there is a large number
   of students, such as in Massive Open Online Courses. Here, we propose
   two new measures devised to evaluate the similarity between concept maps
   based on two deep-learning embedding models: InferSent and Universal
   Sentence Encoder. An experimental evaluation with a sample of teachers
   confirms the validity of one such deep-learning model as the baseline of
   the new similarity measure. Subsequently, we present a proof-of-concept
   dashboard where the measures are used to encode a concept map in a 2D
   space point, with the aim of helping teachers monitor students'
   concept-mapping activity.},

Abstract = {The orchestration of collaborative learning activities in
   technology-enhanced classrooms has become a nontrivial endeavor for
   educators. Depending on the behaviors and needs of students that emerge
   in real educational situations, educators may need to orchestrate
   activity adaptations on the fly. These adaptations may range from the
   provision of additional scaffolding by the educator (e.g., the
   educator's participation in a group discussion) to a change in the
   planned pedagogical scenario (e.g., the duration). This article aims to
   contribute to the orchestration of technology-mediated collaborative
   learning sessions in a classroom context. We present the design,
   implementation, and evaluation of a teacher-facing dashboard that
   supports teachers in orchestrating scripted collaboration. Evaluation
   studies were conducted in 16 classroom sessions. The findings indicate
   that teachers found the information on the dashboard to be actionable
   and help facilitate just in time support to student groups.},

Title = {Mobile learning analytics in higher education: usability testing and
   evaluation of an app prototype},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4, SI},
Pages = {332-347},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of the study was to test the usability of the MyLA
   app prototype by its potential users. Furthermore, the Web app will be
   introduced in the framework of ``Mobile Learning Analytics{''}, a
   cooperation project between the Cooperative State University Mannheim
   and University of Mannheim. The participating universities focus on the
   support of personalized and self-regulated learning. MyLA collects data
   such as learning behavior, as well as personality traits. Last but not
   least, the paper will contribute to the topic of learning analytics and
   mobile learning in higher education.
   Design/methodology - For the empirical investigation, a mixed-method
   design was chosen. While 105 participants took part in the conducted
   online survey, after testing the app prototype, seven students joined an
   additional eye tracking study. For the quantitative part, a selected
   question pool from HIMATT (highly integrated model assessment technology
   and tools) instrument was chosen. The eye tracking investigation
   consisted of three tasks the participants had to solve.
   Findings - The findings showed that the students assessed the idea of
   the app, as well as the navigation positively. Only the color scheme of
   the prototype was not very attractive to a noticeable amount of the
   participants. So, it requires slight modifications concerning the app
   design. For the eye tracking study, it can be stated that the students
   viewed the relevant parts, and they basically had no difficulties to
   solve the tasks.
   Originality/value - Due to the empirical testing of the app prototype,
   the project team was able to adjust the application and to add further
   features. Furthermore, the backend was programmed and an additional tool
   (MyLA dashboard) was developed for lecturers. A mutual understanding of
   the targets, privacy issue and relevant features are indispensable for
   further development of the project.},

Title = {A framework for co-designing effective LADs supporting sensemaking and
   decision making},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LAD) deserve increasing attention, yet
   their adoption remains limited. Designing effective LAD is a difficult
   process, and LADs often fail in turning insights into action. We argue
   that providing explicit decision-making features in a participatory
   design process may help to develop LADs supporting action. We first
   examine how the decision-making process is reflected on LADs. Second, we
   review the literature to identify major design space dimensions and
   examine how to include decision-making features. Third, we propose the
   DEFLAD design framework to synthesise this review which provides
   explicit decision-making features in three dimensions: goal expression
   as a situation awareness level, visualisation and related interactions,
   as support of decision-making process. Fourth, we consider how this
   framework is involved through every stage of a human-centred design
   (HCD) process to express and manage such features. The main contribution
   of this paper is to provide a framework integrating the decision-making
   features in a participatory design process of LADs. Furthermore, we
   demonstrate the implementation of our proposals through the development
   of a card-based toolkit to assist in the ideation phase of participatory
   design, and present feedback from participants of a workshop utilising
   this tool as a proof of concept.},

Title = {More, better feedback please: are learning analytics dashboards (LAD)
   the solution to a wicked problem?},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {69-85},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {There is a long-standing lack of learner satisfaction with quality and
   quantity of feedback in health professions education (HPE) and training.
   To address this, university and training programmes are increasingly
   using technological advancements and data analytic tools to provide
   feedback. One such educational technology is the Learning Analytic
   Dashboard (LAD), which holds the promise of a comprehensive view of
   student performance via partial or fully automated feedback delivered to
   learners in real time. The possibility of displaying performance data
   visually, on a single platform, so users can access and process feedback
   efficiently and constantly, and use this to improve their performance,
   is very attractive to users, educators and institutions. However, the
   mainstream literature tends to take an atheoretical and instrumentalist
   view of LADs, a view that uncritically celebrates the promise of LAD's
   capacity to provide a `technical fix' to the `wicked problem' of
   feedback in health professions education. This paper seeks to recast the
   discussion of LADs as something other than a benign material technology
   using the lenses of Miller and Rose's technologies of government and
   Barry's theory of Technological Societies, where such technical devices
   are also inherently agentic and political. An examination of the
   purpose, design and deployment of LADs from these theoretical
   perspectives can reveal how these educational devices shape and govern
   the HPE learner body in different ways, which in turn, may produce a
   myriad of unintended- and ironic- effects on the feedback process. In
   this Reflections article we wish to encourage health professions
   education scholars to examine the practices and consequences thereof of
   the ever-expanding use of LADs more deeply and with a sense of urgency.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics has been widely used in the field of education. Most
   studies have adopted a learning analytics dashboard to present data on
   learning processes or learning outcomes. However, only presenting
   learning analytics results was not sufficient and lacked personalised
   feedback. In response to these gaps, this study proposed a learning
   analytics-based personalised feedback approach and examined the effects
   of the proposed approach on collaborative knowledge building, emotional
   status, co-regulated behavioural patterns and cognitive load. The
   learning analytics-based personalised feedback approach adopted a deep
   neural network model, namely Bert (bidirectional encoder representations
   from transformers), to automatically classify discussion transcripts in
   online collaborative learning. In total, 60 undergraduate students
   participated in this exploratory study and were randomly assigned into
   experimental and control groups. The students in the experimental group
   learned with the learning analytics-based personalised feedback
   approach, and the students in the control group learned with the
   traditional online collaborative learning approach. The learning
   analytics-based approach was found to have significant impacts and no
   significant difference in cognitive load was noted between the
   experimental and control groups.},

Abstract = {Collaborative learning is considered a critical 21st century skill. Much
   is known about its contribution to learning, but still investigating a
   process of collaboration remains a challenge. This paper approaches the
   investigation on collaborative learning from a psychophysiological
   perspective. An experiment was set up to explore whether biosensors can
   play a role in analysing collaborative learning. On the one hand, we
   identified five physiological coupling indices (PCIs) found in the
   literature: 1) Signal Matching (SM), 2) Instantaneous Derivative
   Matching (IDM), 3) Directional Agreement (DA), 4) Pearson's correlation
   coefficient (PCC) and the 5) Fisher's z-transform (FZT) of the PCC. On
   the other hand, three collaborative learning measurements were used: 1)
   collaborative will (CW), 2) collaborative learning product (CLP) and 3)
   dual learning gain (DLG). Regression analyses showed that out of the
   five PCIs, IDM related the most to CW and was the best predictor of the
   CLP. Meanwhile, DA predicted DLG the best. These results play a role in
   determining informative collaboration measures for designing a learning
   analytics, biofeedback dashboard.},

Abstract = {Our world is significantly shaped by digitalization, fostering new
   opportunities for technology-mediated learning. Therefore, massive
   amounts of knowledge become available online. However, concurrently
   these formats entail less interaction and guidance from lecturers. Thus,
   learners need to be supported by intelligent learning tools that provide
   suitable knowledge in a tailored way. In this context, the use of
   learning analytics in its multifaceted forms is essential. Existing
   literature shows a proliferation of learning analytics use cases without
   a systematic structure. Based on a structured literature review of 42
   papers we organized existing literature contributions systematically and
   derived four use cases: learning dashboards, individualized content,
   tutoring systems, and adaptable learning process based on personality.
   Our use cases will serve as a basis for a targeted scientific discourse
   and are valuable orientation for the development of future learning
   analytics use cases to give rise to the new form of Learning Experience
   Platforms.},

Abstract = {I first met Jim Greer at the NATO Advanced Study Institute on Syntheses
   of Instructional Sciences and Computing Science for Effective
   Instructional Computing Systems in 1990 in Calgary, Canada. It was
   during this meeting that I came to realize that Jim was one of those
   rare individuals that could help ``translate{''} computer science
   principles to non-computer scientists. Through this translation process
   new knowledge could be developed through interdisciplinary partnerships
   with psychology and education. In this paper, I describe the manner in
   which Jim influenced my own journey in the field of Artificial
   Intelligence and Education. In particular, he has influenced two
   directions in my research, one direction is the manner in which
   technology can influence teaching and learning for individuals working
   solo. The second direction is how technology can influence teaching and
   learning through collaboration. In both situations I will discuss Jim
   Greer's influence on my research with respect to learner modelling,
   educational data mining, and visualization. In the context of solo
   learning, I will discuss BioWorld, a system that fosters clinical
   reasoning in medical students, emphasizing the role of student modeling
   and educational data mining for fostering and identifying performance
   differences in clinical reasoning. In the context of collaborative
   learning, I will discuss HOWARD, an online platform for supporting small
   group problem-based learning in medical students. In particular, I will
   discuss the role of learning analytics used in a pedagogical dashboard
   to foster teachers' interpretation of group learning.},

   Dashboards and Their Following Learning Behaviours:A Study of Three

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},

Abstract = {An essential part of making dashboards more effective in motivating
   students and leading to desirable behavioural change is knowing what
   information to communicate to the student and how to frame and present
   it. Most of the research studying dashboards' impact on learning
   analyzes learning indicators of students as a group. Understanding how a
   student's learning unfolds after viewing the dashboard is necessary for
   personalized dashboard selection and its content. In the context of the
   discussion activity, we analyzed 28,290 actions of 896 students after
   they saw their learning status on the dashboards, which were integrated
   into 21 discussions in 11 courses. We provide a comparative perspective
   on three dashboard types: the class average, the leaderboard, and
   message-quality dashboards. Our results indicate that students'
   behaviours after viewing three dashboards were associated with their
   displayed standing in the discussion: views showing the student's status
   below the frame of reference were associated with a higher likelihood of
   posting, and views of the student outperforming the norm with diminished
   further posting, although demonstrating higher discussion engagement. We
   reiterate a need to understand the impact of dashboard states on
   students' behaviour, creating a foundation for a personalized selection
   of dashboard views based on individual students' standing.},

Abstract = {One of the main challenges in teaching and learning activities is the
   assessment: it allows teachers and learners to improve the future
   activities on the basis of the previous ones. It allows a deep analysis
   and understanding of the whole learning process. This is particularly
   difficult in virtual learning environments where a general overview is
   not always available. In the latest years, Learning Analytics are
   becoming the most popular methods to analyze the data collected in the
   learning environments in order to support teachers and learners in the
   complex process of learning. If they are properly integrated in learning
   activities, indeed, they can supply useful information to adapt the
   activities on the basis of student's needs. In this context, the paper
   presents a solution for the digitally enhanced assessment. Two different
   Learning Dashboards have been designed in order to represent the most
   interesting Learning Analytics aiming at providing teachers and learners
   with easy understandable view of learning data in virtual learning
   environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents exploratory research regarding the design and
   evaluation of a dashboard supporting the advising of aspiring university
   students incorporating a black-box predictive model for student success.
   While black-box predictive models can provide accurate predictions,
   incorporating them in dashboards is challenging as the black-box nature
   can threaten the interpretability and negatively impact trust of
   end-users. Explainable Learning Analytics aims to provide insights to
   black-box predictions by for instance explaining how the input features
   impact the prediction made. Two dashboards were designed to visualize
   the prediction and the outcome of the explainer. The dashboards
   supplemented the explainer with an interactive visualisation allowing to
   simulate how changes in the student's features impact the prediction.
   Both dashboards were evaluated in user tests with 13 participants. The
   results show the potential of explainable AI techniques to bring
   predictive models to advising practice. We found that the combination of
   the explainer with the simulation helped users to compare the predictive
   model with their mental models of student success, challenging
   understanding of users and influencing trust in the predictive model.},

Abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) have the power to influence
   lecturers' practices in the classroom and to improve students' learning.
   Many ITS provide standardized analytical methods to evaluate classroom
   performance or the results of the exercises. But they lack more
   sophisticated, flexible and individual analyses. This paper presents an
   e-learning Analytics Tool (EAT) for an ITS that provides a dashboard
   with key figures and a flexible analytics board (FAB). This enables
   lecturers to analyze students' performance in detail and identify
   misconceptions. For instance, the FAB allows us to classify student
   solutions, reveal conceptual errors in exercises, and analyze each part
   of an exercise. By this, common mistakes can be identified, and tailored
   feedback can be given to the students. Following the design science
   approach, the platform is designed in a general way so that it can be
   used for different types of exercises (e.g., Math, Excel, SQL). To
   assess the artifact, we conducted group interviews with German
   University lecturers from various courses. The results show that
   lecturers require a good overview of the submitted student solutions to
   provide timely feedback. They also appreciate the flexible analytics
   tool for detailed analyses of student solutions to understand student
   mistakes better. The employed architecture allows general analyses of
   exercises and the content of students' solutions. In addition, the EAT
   is not bound to a specific kind of exercise, but can cope with different
   kinds like SQL and Excel.},

Abstract = {Teachers play a major role during CSCL by monitoring and stimulating the
   types of interactions between students that are conducive to learning.
   Teacher dashboards are increasingly being developed to aid teachers in
   monitoring students' collaborative activities, thereby constituting a
   form of indirect support for CSCL in the classroom. However, the process
   of how teachers find and interpret relevant information from dashboards,
   and which help they need during this process, remains largely
   unexamined. We first describe how we arrived at the design of a
   prototype teacher dashboard in the context of primary school fraction
   assignments, based on teacher interviews. We then report an experimental
   study (n = 53) to investigate the effect of the type of support a
   teacher dashboard offers (mirroring, alerting, or advising) on teachers'
   detection and interpretation of potentially problematic situations where
   intervention might be needed. The results showed that the type of
   support did not influence detection of events, but did influence
   teachers' interpretation of a CSCL situation.},

Abstract = {Mobile and Ubiquitous Learning (m/u-learning) are finding an increasing
   adoption in education. They are often distinguished by hybrid learning
   environments that encompass elements of formal and informal learning, in
   activities that happen in distributed settings (indoors and outdoors),
   across physical and virtual spaces. Despite their purported benefits,
   these environments imply additional complexity in the design, monitoring
   and evaluation of learning activities. The research literature on
   learning design (LD) and learning analytics (LA) has started to deal
   with these issues. This paper presents a systematic literature review of
   LD and LA, in m/u-learning. Apart from providing an overview of the
   current research in the field, this review elicits elements of common
   ground between both communities, as shown by the similar learning
   contexts and complementary research contributions, and based on the
   research gaps, proposes to: address m/u-learning beyond higher education
   settings, reinforce the connection between physical and virtual learning
   spaces, and more systematically align LD and LA processes.},

   techniques combined with explainable machine learning to provide
   automatic and intelligent actionable feedback that supports students
   self-regulation of learning in a data-driven manner. Prior studies
   within the field of learning analytics predict students' performance and
   use the prediction status as feedback without explaining the reasons
   behind the prediction. Our proposed method, which has been developed
   based on LMS data from a university course, extends this approach by
   explaining the root causes of the predictions and automatically provides
   data-driven recommendations for action. The underlying predictive model
   effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated, with the results
   demonstrating 90 per cent accuracy.},

Title = {TEADASH: Implementing and Evaluating a Teacher-Facing Dashboard Using
   Design Science Research},
Journal = {INFORMATICS-BASEL},
Year = {2024},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The benefits of teacher-facing dashboards are incontestable, yet their
   evidence is finite in terms of long-term use, meaningful usability, and
   maturity level. Thus, this paper uses design science research and
   critical theory to design and develop TEADASH to support teachers in
   making decisions on teaching and learning. Three cycles of design
   science research and multiple small loops were implemented to develop
   the dashboard. The tool was then deployed and evaluated in real time
   with the authentic courses. Five courses from two Swedish universities
   were included in this study. The co-design with teachers is crucial to
   the applicability of this dashboard, while letting teachers use the tool
   during their courses is more important to help them to recognize the
   features they actually use and the tool's usefulness for their teaching
   practices. TEADASH can address the prior matters, align with the
   learning design, and meet teachers' needs. The technical and co-design
   aspects, as well as the advantages and challenges of applying TEADASH in
   practice, are also discussed here.},

Abstract = {This study aims to investigate learners' interaction with the learning
   dashboards as a predictor outcome of an online learning experience and,
   to what extent this interaction data could be used to predict and/or
   provide guidance through their academic performance. For this purpose, a
   prescriptive learning dashboard integrated into an e-learning
   environment was developed as a learning analytics tool. The participants
   consisted of 126 higher education students enrolled in the 12-week
   Computer Networks and Communication course. Data gathered through logs
   and academic performances of learners were analysed with data mining
   techniques. The result of cluster analysis, based on interaction with
   the prescriptive learning dashboard, showed that learners were separated
   into four groups according to their behavioural patterns. A similar
   pattern appears when the related clusters are profiled based on the
   academic performances. At predictive analysis, the study indicates that
   the interaction with prescriptive learning dashboard had certain effects
   on academic performance of learners significantly and artificial neural
   networks algorithm yielded the best performance for predicting academic
   performance. The results support that the usage prescriptive learning
   dashboards can be applied in online courses as an instructional aid to
   improve performance of learners and learning design in e-learning
   environments.},

Abstract = {The development of technology has meant that in the last two decades
   Information and Communication Technologies have become more and more
   involved in the teaching process and have tried to change traditional
   learning models. With the support of modern technology, platforms have
   been developed and perfected that encourage the adoption of a new
   virtual learning paradigm. These platforms store student and teacher
   interactions with course resources in database engines, information that
   can be very relevant, but in many cases has not been processed in a way
   that is useful for use by teachers and students. Therefore, this study
   aims to implement and evaluate a dashboard for student behavior analysis
   and dropout prediction in Moodie. The tool will help teachers to know
   what students do before, during and after a class mediated by virtual
   platforms. In addition, it will also help students manage their learning
   process and easily and effectively monitor their progress in the course.
   Given the analytical nature of the research, exploratory analysis of the
   Moodie data model, evaluation of existing visualizations and design of
   the tool based on Moodie architecture were used to develop a dashboard
   of visualizations and dropout prediction. As a result, FlipMyLearning
   was implemented, a plugin for the Moodie platform that allows the
   teacher to monitor the learning process of students for informed
   decision making. The developed plugin contains visualizations for both
   the teacher and the student, divided into different sections, each
   oriented to monitor different aspects of the course. The research
   conducted shows that the visualizations generated were useful for both
   teachers and students who participated in the evaluation process. In
   addition, variables such as time spent, number of sessions and
   indicators related to cognitive depth and social breadth are useful
   variables to identify groups of students at risk of dropping out.},

Abstract = {In order to improve online learning outcomes, a Learning Dashboard (LD)
   for online students is being developed as a plugin for the learning
   management system Moodle to support self-regulation. The project itself
   focuses on the factors that lead to success and failure in online
   learning. Using a user-centered design approach, the LD will provide
   students with feedback and functional elements through different cards.
   24 online students completed a three-part term paper in which they
   examined the elements of two wireframes of the LD in relation to
   Wertheimer's Gestalt Laws and in terms of factual and interaction
   problems. We also received 11 card designs from them as a voluntary
   bonus assignment. Assignments 1 \& 2 had to be completed successfully in
   order to be admitted to the exam. The study was designed to encourage
   student participation and improve accessibility by taking into account
   their expertise. The results showed that clearer overviews,
   clarification of how content elements fit together, more compact
   solutions, and intuitive controls improved clarity and usability.},

Abstract = {The creation of Inclusive and Accessible Open Educational Resources
   (IA-OERs) is a challenge for teachers because they have to invest time
   and effort to create learning contents considering students' learning
   needs and preferences. An IA-OER is characterized by its alignment with
   the Universal Design Learning (UDL) principles, the quality on its
   contents and the web accessibility as a way to address the diversity of
   students. Creating an IA-OER with these characteristics is not a
   straightforward task, especially when teachers do not have enough
   information/feedback to make decisions on how to improve the learning
   contents. In this paper we introduce ATCE an Analytics Tool to Trace the
   Creation and Evaluation of IA-OERs. This tool focuses in particular on
   the accessibility and quality of the IA-OERs. ATCE was developed as a
   module within the ATutor Learning Management System (LMS). An analytics
   dashboard with visualizations related to the teachers' competences in
   the creation and evaluation of IA-OERs was included as part of the tool.
   This paper also presents a use case of the visualizations obtained from
   the creation and evaluation of one IA-OER after using our analytics
   tool.},

Title = {Using Digital Dashboards in the context of skill-based assessments in
   primary and secondary education: a case study},
Journal = {QUESTIONS VIVES-RECHERCHES EN EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Number = {31},
Abstract = {Over the course of the last decade, teachers have been increasingly
   pressured to use digital artefacts in the classroom, and to shift from
   grade-based assessment to skill-based assessment. Dashboards have been
   used in various educational settings; they could help bridge the gap
   between these two expectations. Based on Engestrom's activity theory, we
   explore the contradictions that could rise if educational dashboards
   were to be used in an evaluation context. This article is based on a
   case study, the design of an application. Collective semi-structured
   interviews based on dashboards' mock-ups were conducted with a panel of
   teachers from both elementary and middle school. Either the additional
   time required to deepen the evaluation is too high to enable the use of
   the dashboard, or the teacher would rather save time by relying heavily
   on the diagnostic abilities of the application. Given that the artefact
   is blind to the characteristics of both the didactic situation and of
   the learners, the dashboard is likely to produce incoherent diagnostics.},

Abstract = {Instructional technologists and faculty in post-secondary institutions
   have increasingly adopted learning analytics interventions such as
   dashboards that provide real-time feedback to students to support
   student' ability to regulate their learning. But analyses of the
   effectiveness of such interventions can be confounded by measures of
   students' prior learning as well as their baseline level of
   self-regulated learning. For this research study, we sought to examine
   whether the frequency of accessing a dashboard was associated with
   learning outcomes after matching subjects on confounding variables. And
   because prior research has suggested that measures of prior learning are
   associated with students' likelihood to use learning analytics
   interventions, we sought to adequately control for learners' likelihood
   to access the feedback by using a propensity score matching with a
   non-binary treatment variable. We administered the Motivated Strategies
   for Learning Questionnaire and also collected demographic information
   for a propensity score matching process. Users' frequency of accessing
   the intervention was categorized as High, Moderate, or Low/No usage.
   After matching users on characteristics associated with dashboard usage
   (gender, high school GPA, and the ``Test Anxiety{''} and ``Self
   Efficacy{''} factors) we found that both the ``High{''} and
   ``Moderate{''} users achieved significantly higher course grades than
   the ``Low/No{''} users. The results suggest learners benefited from
   regularly accessing the feedback, but extreme amounts of usage were not
   necessary to achieve a positive effect. We discuss the implications for
   recommending how students use learning analytics interventions without
   excessively accessing feedback.},

Abstract = {As information technology advanced, accuracy of technology-driven
   assessment is being improved. In order to assess learning performance
   and awareness, assessment of metacognition level with technology can be
   useful to understand learner's learning comprehension and awareness.
   Metacognition is one of the most important elements for successful
   learning. However, current way to evaluate metacognition level focuses
   on psychological method such as questionnaire and interview. The recent
   growth of learning analytics research has demonstrated the relationships
   between metacognition, learning awareness, and learning behaviors. This
   study aims to investigate metacognitive learning behaviors using small
   grain data on eBook and learning analytics dashboard (LAD) over eight
   weeks in a university course. To do so, we determined high and low
   metacognitive learner groups using the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory
   and investigated the differences between the two groups in eBook and
   LAD. The findings suggest that four learning behaviors eBook and LAD
   were detected as metacognitive learning behaviors, and contribute to the
   improvement of technology-driven assessment.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a teacher dashboard intervention study in secondary
   school practice involving teachers (n = 16) with their classes (n = 22)
   and students (n = 403). A quasi-experimental treatment-control group
   design was implemented to compare student learning outcomes between
   classrooms where teachers did not have access to the dashboard and
   classrooms where teachers had access to the dashboard. We examined
   different points in the impact chain of the ``LA Cockpit,{''} a teacher
   dashboard with a feedback system through which teachers can send
   feedback to their students on student learning. To investigate this
   impact chain from teacher use of dashboards to student learning, we
   analyzed 1) teachers' perceived technology acceptance of the LA Cockpit,
   2) teacher feedback practices using the LA Cockpit, and 3) student
   knowledge gains as measured by pre- and post-tests. The analysis of n =
   355 feedback messages sent by teachers through the LA Cockpit revealed
   that the dashboard assists teachers in identifying students facing
   difficulties and that teachers mostly provided process feedback, which
   is known to be effective for student learning. For student learning,
   significantly higher knowledge gains were found in the teacher dashboard
   condition compared to the control condition.},

Title = {SBGTool v2.0: An Empirical Study on a Similarity-Based Grouping Tool for
   Students' Learning Outcomes},
Journal = {DATA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Visual learning analytics (VLA) tools and technologies enable the
   meaningful exchange of information between educational data and
   teachers. This allows teachers to create meaningful groups of students
   based on possible collaboration and productive discussions. VLA tools
   also allow a better understanding of students' educational demands.
   Finding similar samples in huge educational datasets, however, involves
   the use of effective similarity measures that represent the teacher's
   purpose. In this study, we conducted a user study and improved our
   web-based similarity-based grouping VLA tool, (SBGTool) to help teachers
   categorize students into groups based on their similar learning outcomes
   and activities. SBGTool v2.0 differs from SBGTool due to design changes
   made in response to teacher suggestions, the addition of sorting options
   to the dashboard table, the addition of a dropdown component to group
   the students into classrooms, and improvement in some visualizations. To
   counteract color blindness, we have also considered a number of color
   palettes. By applying SBGTool v2.0, teachers may compare the outcomes of
   individual students inside a classroom, determine which subjects are the
   most and least difficult over the period of a week or an academic year,
   identify the numbers of correct and incorrect responses for the most
   difficult and easiest subjects, categorize students into various groups
   based on their learning outcomes, discover the week with the most
   interactions for examining students' engagement, and find the
   relationship between students' activity and study success. We used
   10,000 random samples from the EdNet dataset, a large-scale hierarchical
   educational dataset consisting of student-system interactions from
   multiple platforms at the university level, collected over a two-year
   period, to illustrate the tool's efficacy. Finally, we provide the
   outcomes of the user study that evaluated the tool's effectiveness. The
   results revealed that even with limited training, the participants were
   able to complete the required analysis tasks. Additionally, the
   participants' feedback showed that the SBGTool v2.0 gained a good level
   of support for the given tasks, and it had the potential to assist
   teachers in enhancing collaborative learning in their classrooms.},

   for a learning analytics cockpit with teachers},

Abstract = {Background: Teacher dashboards can help secondary school teachers manage
   online learning activities and inform instructional decisions by
   visualising information about class learning. However, when designing
   teacher dashboards, it is not trivial to choose which information to
   display, because not all of the vast amount of information retrieved
   from digital learning environments is useful for teaching. Information
   elicited from formative assessment (FA), though, is a strong predictor
   for student performance and can be a useful data source for effective
   teacher dashboards. Especially in the secondary education context, FA
   and feedback on FA, have been extensively studied and shown to
   positively affect student learning outcomes. Moreover, secondary
   teachers struggle to make sense of the information displayed in
   dashboards and decide on pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback
   to students. Objectives: To facilitate the provision of feedback for
   secondary school teachers via a teacher dashboard, this study identifies
   requirements for designing a Learning Analytics Cockpit (LA Cockpit),
   that is, (1) a teacher dashboard that provides teachers with
   visualisations of results from formative assessment (FA) and (2) a
   feedback system that supports teachers in providing feedback to
   students. Methods: This study was conducted in the context of STEM
   classes and is based on semi-structured co-design interviews with German
   secondary school teachers. In these interviews, we first explored
   challenges teachers encountered in monitoring students' learning and
   providing feedback. Second, in the ideation phase, teachers were asked
   to define features an LA Cockpit for FA should have. Finally, in the
   evaluation phase, we provided teachers with a design template for an LA
   Cockpit, the LAC\_Template, which was built upon our previous work and
   feedback theory, and asked them to evaluate and improve it. Further
   design requirements were derived based on the evaluation of the
   LAC\_Template and teachers' suggestions for improvement. Results: We
   derived 16 requirements for designing an LA Cockpit for FA in secondary
   schools. Findings from the interviews indicated that the feedback system
   of an LA Cockpit should address teachers' time limitations in giving
   students individualised feedback. It should therefore be designed to
   minimise the steps required to deliver feedback. To reduce workload,
   teachers requested an automated reminder to send feedback, but with the
   ability to adjust feedback to the learning context. Such a
   semi-automated feedback system can help teachers support students
   individually but also underline the importance of actively involving
   teachers in the feedback loop and giving them control when using such
   technologies in secondary school practice. A challenge for future
   teacher dashboard designs could be to find a balance between technology
   and teacher control that utilises the strengths of both in a beneficial
   combination.},

Abstract = {Society demands new competences from professionals, who require having
   specific skills and abilities. Universities, accordingly, have changed
   from a content-based towards a competency-based educational model.
   However, the assessment of these competences is not a scalable task, has
   a subjective nature and must consider data from many different sources.
   This paper describes the model, architecture and objectives of an
   on-going research project aimed at developing a web platform called
   LACAMOLC, to provide teachers and students a dashboard which gathers
   usage and social data from different Knowledge and Learning Technologies
   such as Moodle, Google Apps for Education and MediaWiki to provide
   visual and learning analytics visualizations to support learning and
   assessment process. We select Pentaho as our analytics specific tool,
   based on its characteristics in order to effectively scale learning
   analytics systems and achieve long-term sustainability and scalability,
   and we design an experiment to carry out for teamwork competence.},

Title = {Making Sense of Sensemaking: Understanding How K-12 Teachers and Coaches
   React to Visual Analytics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},

Pages = {60+},
Abstract = {With the spread of learning analytics (LA) dashboards in K-12 schools,
   educators are increasingly expected to make sense of data to inform
   instruction. However, numerous features of school settings, such as
   specialized vantage points of educators, may lead to different ways of
   looking at data. This observation motivates the need to carefully
   observe and account for the ways data sensemaking occurs, and how it may
   differ across K-12 professional roles. Our mixed-methods study reports
   on interviews and think-aloud sessions with middle-school mathematics
   teachers and instructional coaches from four districts in the United
   States. By exposing educators to an LA dashboard, we map their varied
   reactions to visual data and reveal prevalent sensemaking patterns. We
   find that emotional, analytical, and intentional responses inform
   educators' sensemaking and that different roles at the school afford
   unique vantage points toward data. Based on these findings, we offer a
   typology for representing sensemaking in a K-12 school context and
   reflect on how to expand visual LA process models.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are designed as feedback tools for
   learners, but until recently, learners rarely have had a say in how LADs
   are designed and what information they receive through LADs. To overcome
   this shortcoming, we have developed a customisable LAD for Coursera
   MOOCs on which learners can set goals and choose indicators to monitor.
   Following a mixed-methods approach, we analyse 401 learners' indicator
   selection behaviour in order to understand the decisions they make on
   the LAD and whether learner goals and self-regulated learning skills
   influence these decisions. We found that learners overwhelmingly chose
   indicators about completed activities. Goals are not associated with
   indicator selection behaviour, while help-seeking skills predict
   learners' choice of monitoring their engagement in discussions and time
   management skills predict learners' interest in procrastination
   indicators. The findings have implications for our understanding of
   learners' use of LADs and their design.},

Abstract = {This methodological-theoretical synergy provides an integrative
   framework of learning analytics through the development of the
   human-and-machine symbiotic reinforcement learning. The framework
   intends to address the challenges of the current learning analytics
   model, including a lack of internal validity, generalizability,
   immediacy, transferability, and interpretability for precision
   education. The proposed framework consists of a master component (the
   brain) and its four subsuming components: social networking, the smart
   classroom, the intelligent agent, and the dashboard. The brain component
   takes in and analyzes multimodal streams of student data from the other
   components with the model-based reinforcement learning, which forms
   policies of adequate actions that maximize the long-term rewards for
   both the human and machine in the seamless learning environment. An
   example case plan in advanced statistics was demonstrated to illustrate
   the course description, data collected in each component, and how the
   components meet different features of the smart learning environment to
   deliver precision education. An empirical demonstration was provided

Abstract = {One apparent challenge associated with learning analytics (LA) has been
   to promote adoption by university educators. Researchers suggest that a
   visualization dashboard could serve to help educators use LA to improve
   learning design (LD) practice. We therefore used an educational design
   approach to develop a pedagogically useful and easy-to-use LA
   visualization solution to support data-informed LD. We interviewed four
   staff in a medical degree program at a New Zealand university, designed
   and piloted a dashboard, and evaluated it through interviews. As a
   proof-of-concept project, our study showed that educational design
   research could be meaningfully used to develop a visualization dashboard
   that is easy-to-use and useful. In particular, the preliminary design
   principles identified provide implications for practitioners who are
   seeking to use LA to inform LD. Finally, we reflect on the purpose of
   visualization dashboards in relation to the literature and identify
   areas for future developments.},

Abstract = {Research indicates that makerspaces equip students with the practical
   skills needed to build their own projects and thrive in the
   twenty-first-century workforce. While the appeal of makerspaces lies in
   their spirit of tinkering and community-driven ethos, these same
   attributes make it difficult to monitor and facilitate learning.
   Makerspaces also attract students from diverse backgrounds and skills,
   further challenging facilitators to accommodate the needs of each
   student and their self-directed projects. We propose a dashboard
   interface that visualizes Kinect sensor data to aid facilitators in
   monitoring student collaboration. The tool was designed with an
   iterative and participatory approach. Five facilitators were involved at
   each phase of the design process, from need-finding to prototyping to
   implementation and evaluation. Insights derived from interviews were
   used to inform the design decisions of the final interface. The final
   evaluation suggests that the use of normalized summary scores and an
   interactive network graph can successfully support facilitators in tasks
   related to improving collaboration. Moreover, the use of a red-green
   color scheme and the inclusion of student photos improved the usability
   for facilitators, but issues of trustworthiness need to be further
   examined.},

Title = {Four design principles for learner dashboards that support student

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to take a student-centred
   perspective to understanding the range of ways that students respond to
   receiving information about their learning behaviours presented on a
   dashboard. It identifies four principles to inform the design of
   dashboards which support learner agency and empowerment, features which
   Prinsloo and Slade (2016) suggest are central to ethical adoption of
   learning analytics. Design/methodology/approach The study involved
   semi-structured interviews with 24 final-year undergraduates to explore
   the students' response to receiving dashboards that showed the students'
   achievement and other learning behaviours. Findings The paper identifies
   four principles that should be used when designing and adopting learner
   dashboards to support student agency and empowerment.
   Research limitations/implications - The study was based on a small
   sample of undergraduate students from the final year from one academic
   school. The data are based on students' self-reporting.
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that these four principles
   are guiding tenets for the design and implementation of learner
   dashboards in higher education. The four principles are: designs that
   are customisable by students; foregrounds students sense making; enables
   students to identify actionable insights; and dashboards are embedded
   into educational processes.
   Originality/value The paper's originality is that it illuminates
   student-centred principles of learner dashboard design and adoption.},

Abstract = {Facilitating the collaboration of multiple groups is a critical element
   in problem-based learning (PBL). In face-to-face learning environments,
   PBL facilitators require sufficient information about a group's progress
   and collaboration in real time to make decisions about when and how to
   facilitate. The capacity of facilitator is limited as PBL scales up.
   Online PBL settings can mitigate this challenge by presenting data from
   multiple groups to support facilitators using orchestration technology.
   A learning analytics dashboard with visual displays is one type of
   orchestration technology. This study examined 10 PBL facilitators' use
   of such an orchestration technology to assess the collaboration patterns
   of multiple groups. Think-aloud protocols were collected from PBL
   facilitators as they used the technology to understand group
   collaboration patterns, which were illustrated through learning
   analytics visualizations. The think-aloud method enabled the PBL
   facilitators to verbalize their thought processes, and content analysis
   was conducted to analyze the transcripts. This study found that the
   expert facilitators made consistent formative assessments and
   strategically selected the most relevant visualizations to examine
   knowledge co-construction and group collaboration. In addition, they
   used multiple visualizations to calibrate and confirm their
   understanding of the students' learning and group processes, rather than
   relying on one visualization. Understanding how facilitators use the
   information generated from a learning analytics dashboard to assess
   collaboration in an online PBL environment is critical for better
   support of online facilitation and the design of orchestration
   technology},

Abstract = {With the help of Visual Learning Analytics (VLA) tools, teachers can
   construct meaningful groups of students that can, for example,
   collaborate and be engaged in productive discussions. However, finding
   similar samples in large educational databases requires effective
   similarity measures that capture the teacher's intent. In this paper we
   propose a web-based VLA tool called Similarity-Based Grouping (SBGTool),
   to assist teachers in categorizing students into different groups based
   on their similar learning outcomes and activities. By using SBGTool,
   teachers may compare individual students by considering the number of
   answers (correct and incorrect) in different question categories and
   time ranges, find the most difficult question categories considering the
   percentage of similarity to the correct answers, determine the degree of
   similarity and dissimilarity across students, and find the relationship
   between students' activity and success. To demonstrate the tool's
   efficacy, we used 10,000 random samples from the EdNet dataset, a
   large-scale hierarchical educational dataset consisting of
   student-system interactions from multiple platforms, at university
   level, collected over a period of two years. The results point to the
   conclusion that the tool is efficient, can be adapted to different
   learning domains, and has the potential to assist teachers in maximizing
   the collaborative learning potential in their classrooms.},

   carried out in projects, strategic initiatives, and in national
   initiatives like Analytics Intelligence project (2018-) involving many
   universities to work together, to co-create new innovative solutions and
   approaches to promote excellence in teaching and learning.
   The aim of the paper is to present how we implemented service design
   approach in two separate cases to develop new services for teachers and
   students in university context. The paper covers two development
   experiments, which were conducted in Aalto University Teacher Services
   (https://www.aalto.fi/services/teacher-services-team) during academic
   year 2018-2019 using service design tools and methods to build services

   present work compares the results of two different algorithms used to

   already implemented and integrated on a Moodle dashboard. For the
   comparison, data from a total of 122 students was collected from Moodle
   over four semester of an Introductory Programming course offered at
   Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Models were generated for
   each one of the 17 weeks of the semester, and their AUROC measures were
   then calculated and compared to evaluate the differences between LSTM
   and Adaboost. The results have shown that even though LSTM models
   presented a better performance than Adaboost, these differences were not

Abstract = {There is a growing interest in the research and use of automated
   feedback dashboards that display classroom analytics; yet little is
   known about the detailed processes instructors use to make sense of
   these tools, and to determine the impact on their teaching practices.
   This research was conducted at a public Midwestern university within the
   context of an automated classroom observation and feedback
   implementation project. Fifteen engineering instructors engaged in this
   research. The overarching goal was to investigate instructor teaching
   beliefs, pedagogical practices, and sensemaking processes regarding
   dashboard use. A grounded theory approach was used to identify
   categories related to instructor perceptions. Results revealed that
   instructor experiences inform both their present use of the dashboard
   and consequential future actions. A model is presented that illustrates
   categories included in instructor pre-use, use, and post-use of an
   automated feedback dashboard. An extension to this model is presented
   and accompanied by recommendations for a more effective future use of
   automated dashboards. The model's practical implications inform both
   instructors and designers on effective design and use of dashboards,
   ultimately paving a way to improve pedagogical practices and
   instruction.},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics (LA) is an emergent field which aims at a better
   understanding of students and providing intelligence to learners,
   teachers, and administrators using learning log data. Although the use
   of technology in class is increasing in the K-12 sector as well as
   territory education, cases of effective implementation of LA in
   secondary schools were rarely reported, especially in Japan. In this
   paper, we offer an example where LA is implemented at a junior-high Math
   class in Japan. We introduce our LA platform, LEAF - LMS and e-book
   integrated learning analytics dashboard - and its usage during summer
   vacation period in the target class. We analyzed 121 students' question
   answering logs and their exam performance after the vacation by K-means
   clustering method. As a result, we found that students' progress
   patterns were able to be categorized as four types: early engagement,
   late engagement, high engagement, and low engagement and the early and
   high engagement group got significantly higher scores than the low
   engagement group. It implies the importance of the engagement at the
   beginning of the vacation. Moreover, by comparing the previous studies
   in MOOCs, we concluded that self-regulation skills are an important
   factor for student success in a long vacation period, too. Finally, we
   introduce a monitoring tool which aims to detect and send messages to
   at-risk students at an early stage in the next summer vacation period.
   Our case will become the first model case of how to implement LA in
   secondary school in Japan.},

Abstract = {Researchers recognize the pivotal role of temporal analysis in
   unraveling learning processes from learners' trace data. However, most
   temporal analysis methods focus on clustering similar trajectories, and
   very few offer metrics to characterize the learners' temporal learning
   behavior. This study draws upon a set of sequence indicators that
   characterize students' temporal behavior dynamics. These metrics,
   focusing on sequence length, diversity, and complexity, provide insights
   into students' learning engagement with the course. Applied to a dataset
   of 91 students collected from a Blended Learning course, we studied
   these metrics in relation to the learners' final grades and their
   self-regulatory profiles. Additionally, we assessed the causal effects
   of introducing a Learning Analytics Dashboard, an intervention aimed at
   fostering self-regulated learning, on students' temporal behavior and
   final grades by applying Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW). The
   results show that these metrics serve (1) to characterize individual
   students' dynamics through the course and (2) to provide information
   about the effects of the intervention. In particular, we show that
   students who interacted with the dashboard had significantly more
   complex behavior, but no difference in their final course grades. We
   also revealed that engagement measured as consistent activity might be a
   stronger predictor than specific learning strategies in an order. This
   research contributes with a methodological approach for extracting
   metrics that enrich traditional methods, emphasizing the unique dynamics
   of individual students, and paving the way for future interventions.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Volume = {214},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the context of inclusive education, Universal Design for Learning
   (UDL) is a framework used worldwide to create learning opportunities
   accessible to all learners. While much research focused on the design
   and students' perceptions of UDL-based learning settings, studies on
   students' usage patterns in UDL-guided elements, particularly in digital
   environments, are still scarce. Therefore, we analyze and cluster the
   usage patterns of 9th and 10th graders in a webbased learning platform
   called I3Learn. The platform focuses on chemistry learning, and UDL
   principles guide its design. We collected the temporal usage patterns of
   UDL-guided elements of 384 learners in detailed log files. The collected
   data includes the time spent using video and/or text as a source of
   information, working on learning tasks with or without help and working
   on self-assessments. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to
   identify relevant factors in the observed usage behaviors. Based on the
   factor loadings, we extracted features for k-means clustering and named
   the resulting groups based on their usage patterns and learner
   characteristics. The EFA revealed four factors suggesting that learners
   remain consistent in selecting UDL-guided elements that require a
   decision (video or text, tasks with or without help). Based on these
   four factors, the cluster analysis identifies six different groups. We
   discuss these results as a starting point to provide individualized
   learning support through further artificial intelligence applications
   and inform educators about learner activity through a dashboard.},

Title = {Multimodal Teacher Dashboards: Challenges and Opportunities of Enhancing
   Teacher Insights Through a Case Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {181-201},
Abstract = {Teacher dashboards provide insights on students' progress through
   visualizations and scores derived from data generated during teaching
   and learning activities (e.g., response times and task correctness) to
   improve teaching. Despite the potential usefulness of enhancing teacher
   dashboards, and the respective teaching practices, with rich information
   regarding students' cognitive and affective states (e.g., cognitive
   load), few studies on teacher dashboards have considered such
   information. In this study, we drew on contemporary developments of
   multimodal (MM) learning analytics and designed an MM teacher dashboard
   with a notification system. The proposed system: 1) receives data from
   various sensors; 2) computes relevant cognitive and affective
   measurements; 3) visualizes the resulting measurements in a clean
   customizable interface; and 4) notifies instructors during moments of
   interest, so they may determine an appropriate method to support
   struggling students. To evaluate our MM teacher dashboard, we first
   collected multimodal data (MMD), performance data, and video recordings
   of students' interactions during an in situ study where 26 students
   engaged with a motion-based learning task. Then, we used our MM teacher
   dashboard to present the collected MMD and video recordings to 20
   experienced teachers and educational researchers and collected
   qualitative data regarding respondents' insights on the advantages and
   challenges of visualizing students' MMD. Results showed that teachers
   found an MM teacher dashboard enhanced with a notification system,
   useful to complement their pedagogical practices. We offer empirically
   founded guidelines for design and integration of an MM teacher dashboard
   with notification systems, aimed to enhance teachers' understanding of
   students' learning states (e.g., real-time awareness of students'
   stress).},

   log data relating to student activities. The field of learning analytics
   uses data from learning management systems (LMSs) and student
   information systems to track student progress and predict future
   performance in order to enhance learning environments (Siemens, 2011).
   The aim of this paper is to describe a project where we utilized a
   system developed in Dublin City University to use information about
   student engagement with our LMS, Moodle, to create a model predicting
   pass or failure in certain modules. The project is divided into three
   distinct phases. An initial investigation was completed analyzing Moodle
   activity for the last six years. The purpose of this exercise was to
   determine automatically if ``trends{''} could be identified linking
   Moodle engagement with student attainment. This was done by training a
   machine learning classifier to map student online behaviour, against
   outcomes. Once the classifier was trained, several modules were
   identified as suitable for building a predictor of student exam success.
   Ten modules were identified for semester 1 with a further seven
   identified for semester 2. The second phase involved analyzing current
   students' engagement with these modules and sending students information
   about the predictions of their attainment for the module, based on their
   Moodle engagement. At this stage concerns were raised within the
   university that the data that we share with the students could actually
   have the opposite effect to what we are after, i.e. the student may look
   at the data and think that there is no point in putting in more effort
   as `I'm too far behind already'. Dietz-Uhler and Hurn refer to this as
   ``instead of being a constructive tool, feedback becomes a prophet of
   failure{''} (Dietz-Uhler, 2013). This contention was addressed by
   conducting an online survey with students in an effort to explore their
   experiences of being provided with feedback regarding their engagement
   with the LMS. The third and final phase of this project was the
   development of a dashboard for lecturers to enable monitoring of their
   students' engagement with their module on Moodle. This enables lecturers
   to have an overview of how students are engaging with their course on
   Moodle and quickly identify students who are not engaging with the LMS
   and who are potentially at risk of failure or non-completion. There are
   numerous examples of the use of learning analytics in higher education.
   This study focuses on the provision of data obtained through learning
   analytics to the student and qualitative analysis that was conducted in
   relation to this data. This research adds to the existing research into
   learning analytics being used for student retention.},

Title = {A Theoretical and Evidence-Based Conceptual Design of MetaDash: An
   Intelligent Teacher Dashboard to Support Teachers' Decision Making and
   Students' Self-Regulated Learning},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 19},
Abstract = {Teachers' ability to self-regulate their own learning is closely related
   to their competency to enhance self-regulated learning (SRL) in their
   students. Accordingly, there is emerging research for the design of
   teacher dashboards that empower instructors by providing access to
   quantifiable evidence of student performance and SRL processes.
   Typically, they capture evidence of student learning and performance to
   be visualized through activity traces (e.g., bar charts showing correct
   and incorrect response rates, etc.) and SRL data (e.g., eye-tracking on
   content, log files capturing feature selection, etc.) in order to
   provide teachers with monitoring and instructional tools. Critics of the
   current research on dashboards used in conjunction with advanced
   learning technologies (ALTs) such as simulations, intelligent tutoring
   systems, and serious games, argue that the state of the field is
   immature and has 1) focused only on exploratory or proof-of-concept
   projects, 2) investigated data visualizations of performance metrics or
   simplistic learning behaviors, and 3) neglected most theoretical aspects
   of SRL including teachers' general lack of understanding their's
   students' SRL. Additionally, the work is mostly anecdotal, lacks
   methodological rigor, and does not collect critical process data (e.g.
   frequency, duration, timing, or fluctuations of cognitive, affective,
   metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) SRL processes) during learning
   with ALTs used in the classroom. No known research in the areas of
   learning analytics, teacher dashboards, or teachers' perceptions of
   students' SRL and CAMM engagement has systematically and simultaneously
   examined the deployment, temporal unfolding, regulation, and impact of
   all these key processes during complex learning. In this manuscript, we
   1) review the current state of ALTs designed using SRL theoretical
   frameworks and the current state of teacher dashboard design and
   research, 2) report the important design features and elements within
   intelligent dashboards that provide teachers with real-time data
   visualizations of their students' SRL processes and engagement while
   using ALTs in classrooms, as revealed from the analysis of surveys and
   focus groups with teachers, and 3) propose a conceptual system design
   for integrating reinforcement learning into a teacher dashboard to help
   guide the utilization of multimodal data collected on students' and
   teachers' CAMM SRL processes during complex learning.},

Abstract = {Existing tools aimto detect university studentswith early diagnosis of
   dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that
   let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties.
   In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected
   reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronymfor
   the Spanish name Panel de Analiticas de Aprendizaje deDislexia en
   Adultos), is presented. PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate
   the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better
   understanding by students about their learnermodel. Through information
   visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their
   learner models in order to help themto increase their awareness and to
   support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in
   reading. PADA provides different learning analytics on reading
   performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths
   and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning. This paper describes
   examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts,
   line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal
   details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the
   students. We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of
   different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic. The
   results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and
   help themto understand their difficulties associated with the reading
   tasks, aswell as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the
   learning process. Implications for the design of learning analytics are
   discussed and directions for future work are outlined.},

Abstract = {In this study, we present a case study involving two self-service
   dashboards providing feedback on learning and study skills and on
   academic achievement. These dashboards were offered to first-year
   university students in several study programmes in Flanders, Belgium.
   Data for this study were collected using usage tracking (N = 2875) and a
   survey taken at the beginning of the second year before (N = 484) and
   after (N = 538) the introduction of the dashboards. We found that early
   dashboard usage is related to academic achievement later in the academic
   year and that students' review of the feedback received in the first
   year improved. Although these results are modest in comparison to how
   high the bar is sometimes set for learning analytics applications, we
   argue that low-cost deployments of self-service dashboards are an
   interesting approach to start building experience with similar tools and
   to start paving the way for future developments.},

Abstract = {The growing number of universities adopting some form of e-learning in
   recent years has raised some concerns about how to ensure students'
   authentication, and the authorship of the assessment activities they
   deliver. There are several strategies and market tools that can help
   teachers in these tasks. While the usage of plagiarism detection tools
   for checking authorship is common practice (above all in fully online
   universities), the use of biometric instruments for ensuring students'
   identity is less extended. Although all these tools collect a large
   amount and variety of data, there is a lack of software systems that can
   integrate such data, and show the information that may be extracted from
   these data in a visual and meaningful way that fits the teachers' needs.
   Precisely, the objective of this chapter is to present a set of
   dashboards that integrate data collected by different kinds of
   authentication and authorship instruments, oriented to assist the
   decision-making process of teachers, above all in case of suspicion of
   students' dishonest academic behavior. Although these dashboards have
   been designed and implemented in the context of TeSLA project, the
   experience and conclusions provided here are of interest to researchers
   and practitioners aiming to develop dashboards with learning analytics
   purposes at higher education. For this reason, this chapter also
   provides a discussion and review of the most prominent analytical
   efforts in universities.},

Abstract = {Computer-supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a pedagogical
   strategy associated with how learners construct knowledge with a group
   by computer-based learning system. In recent years, most of the
   computer-based learning systems record the interaction log of each
   learner when developing course assignments. However, the recorded data
   is facing a challenge to expose the learners behaviors during the course
   and to design a computer-supported collaborative learning activity. To
   address those challenges in this paper, a novel collaborative
   programming tool called Software Project Development and Insight
   Learning Environment (SPDI Learning Environment) is described. The SPDI
   Learning Environment allows learners of computer science to develop
   course assignments collaboratively. Besides, it allows instructors to
   investigate the learners behaviors by associating a web-based integrated
   development environment (IDE) with Big Data analysis pipeline and
   Visualization Dashboard. In addition to collect real data from courses,
   we designed learning activities to help teachers to engage the field of
   CSCL and Learning Analytics.},

Abstract = {Collaboration is one of the four important 21st-century skills. With the
   pervasive use of sensors, interest on co-located collaboration (CC) has
   increased lately. Most related literature used the audio modality to
   detect indicators of collaboration (such as total speaking time and turn
   taking). CC takes place in physical spaces where group members share
   their social (i.e., non-verbal audio indicators like speaking time,
   gestures) and epistemic space (i.e., verbal audio indicators like the
   content of the conversation). Past literature has mostly focused on the
   social space to detect the quality of collaboration. In this study, we
   focus on both social and epistemic space with an emphasis on the
   epistemic space to understand different evolving collaboration patterns
   and collaborative convergence and quantify collaboration quality. We
   conduct field trials by collecting audio recordings in 14 different
   sessions in a university setting while the university staff and students
   collaborate over playing a board game to design a learning activity.
   This collaboration task consists of different phases with each
   collaborating member having been assigned a pre-fixed role. We analyze
   the collected group speech data to do role-based profiling and visualize
   it with the help of a dashboard.},

Abstract = {Providing high-quality courses is of utmost importance to drive
   successful learning. This compels course authors to continuously review
   their contents to meet learners' needs. However, it is challenging for
   them to detect the reading barriers that learners face with content, and
   to identify how their courses can be improved accordingly. In this
   paper, we propose a learning analytics approach for assisting course
   authors performing these tasks. Using logs of learners' activity, a set
   of indicators related to course reading activity are computed and used
   to detect issues and to suggest content revisions. The results are
   presented to authors through CoReaDa, a learning dashboard empowered
   with assistive features. We instantiate our proposals using the logs of
   a major European e-learning platform, and validate them through a study.
   Study results show the effectiveness of our approach providing authors
   with more awareness and guidance in improving their courses, to better
   suit learners' requirements.},

Abstract = {This study analyzed and visualized the daily behaviors of teachers on

   the learning management system was routinely used, while the learning
   analytics dashboard was not. Further, we examined how the teacher used
   the dashboard during the experimental classes with a learning analytics
   researcher. The results showed that the use of e-book readers and
   dashboards was encouraged on the day when the researcher attended class
   together. Additionally, the timings when the teacher checked the
   dashboard were getting earlier in each class. These results imply that
   the repeated use of a dashboard and the help of an expert foster the
   literacy of teachers in using educational data in their classes.},

Abstract = {When used in classrooms, personalized learning software allows students
   to work at their own pace, while freeing up the teacher to spend more
   time working one-on-one with students. Yet such personalized classrooms
   also pose unique challenges for teachers, who are tasked with monitoring
   classes working on divergent activities, and prioritizing help-giving in
   the face of limited time. This paper reports on the co-design,
   implementation, and evaluation of a wearable classroom orchestration
   tool for K-12 teachers: mixed-reality smart glasses that augment
   teachers' real-time perceptions of their students' learning,
   metacognition, and behavior, while students work with personalized
   learning software. The main contributions are: (1) the first exploration
   of the use of smart glasses to support orchestration of personalized
   classrooms, yielding design findings that may inform future work on
   real-time orchestration tools; (2) Replay Enactments: a new prototyping
   method for real-time orchestration tools; and (3) an in-lab evaluation
   and classroom pilot using a prototype of teacher smart glasses (Lumilo),
   with early findings suggesting that Lumilo can direct teachers' time to
   students who may need it most.},

Abstract = {Teacher dashboards provide real-time information about students'
   performance and progress, which help K-12 teachers to adjust feedback to
   student' specific needs during learning. Prior research indicated two
   problems with respect to how teachers provide feedback: (i) teachers do
   not always select the most effective feedback to support student'
   learning and (ii) feedback is not allocated equally to students with
   different abilities. Specifically, process feedback is considered most
   effective yet is relatively scarce. In order to understand how
   dashboards influence the type and allocation of feedback, we compared
   characteristics of feedback given after dashboard consultation
   (dashboard-prompted feedback) to feedback triggered by teachers
   themselves or in response to students' questions (human-prompted
   feedback) in thirty-five K-12 classrooms. Results showed that dashboards
   led to equal amounts of task and process feedback, while human-prompts
   led to much more task than process feedback and this difference was
   especially large for low-ability students. Hence the different types of
   dashboard-prompted feedback were more equally distributed among students
   of different ability levels. These results indicate that dashboards can
   have an important equalizing effect on teacher feedback practices.},

Abstract = {Maritime simulators are a central tool for the education and training of
   navigators, allowing them to develop and improve their skills in a
   controlled and replicable environment. Despite efforts to enhance the
   simulation training performance assessment, there are few reliable
   approaches to take advantage of readily available data from simulator
   logs to inform performance evaluation and training adjustments.
   Harnessing this data more effectively could enhance the way we assess
   simulation training and provide a more transparent understanding of
   learning progress and areas for improvement. To develop a learning
   analytics dashboard (LAD) for performance assessment in maritime
   simulation training, we analyse simulator log data with 27 potential
   input features to predict student performance as the target feature.
   After filtering down to 13 potential input features using data
   visualization and expert validation, a cloud artificial intelligence
   platform is used for predicting student performance. A total of 58
   algorithms were trained, of which the eXtreme Gradient Boosted Trees
   Classifier algorithm is adopted for prediction. The results demonstrate
   the potential for utilizing machine learning algorithms in analysing
   maritime navigation training data paving the way for a new direction in
   simulation training assessment.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the implementation of a wellbeing app in a Swedish
   Upper Secondary School. The aim is to understand how ideas of data
   driven school improvement underpinned by promises of artificial
   intelligence (AI) and learning analytics (LA) change the work of
   teachers. The study draws on video-ethnography from 17 meetings between
   five teachers/form tutors. The produced data is analysed using
   actor-network theory to focus on the various stages of the
   implementation process and the interactions between the learning
   analytics dashboard (LAD) and the teachers. To capture the complexity of
   the data, the empirical material is presented through cartoon-inspired
   illustrations grounded in a Thinking through Cartoons methodology.
   Findings show how teachers took on new roles and responsibilities in
   relation to the wellbeing app, most notably the role of collecting data
   from students. Teachers came to act as data analysts which imposed
   constant negotiations and uncertainties. To address the declining
   engagement of students over time, a student-facing LAD was introduced.
   The teachers shifted their focus to motivate students to engage with
   their own data in different ways. Despite no improvements in students'
   response rates teachers remained committed to the app, trusting that new
   AI and LA functionalities would compensate unsatisfactory outcomes. In
   conclusion, instead of improving teachers' capacity to identify at-risk
   students, the wellbeing app increased teachers' workload and led to
   different dilemmas related to teacher-student relations and teachers'
   professional judgement.},

Title = {Development of a multi-model analytics system to enhance decision-making
   in student admission},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 6},
Abstract = {PurposeStudent admission and enrolment are pivotal processes for
   universities, directly influencing institutional planning and academic
   outcomes. To enhance this decision-making process, this paper aims to
   present the development of a multi-model analytics system to predict the
   likelihood of student candidates accepting admission offers and
   achieving good academic results.Design/methodology/approachThe
   multi-model analytics system integrates six machine learning models to
   support data classification and regression. A majority voting approach
   was adopted to combine the results from the top three models and
   generate a comprehensive prediction. In addition, interactive analytics
   dashboards were developed to facilitate data visualisation, enabling
   stakeholders to derive actionable insights from admission trends and
   outcomes.FindingsEvaluation results showed that the system achieved an
   accuracy of 62\%, a recall of 83\% and a precision of 63\%. These
   results demonstrate the system's capability in forecasting student
   admission and enrolment, with a particular strength in identifying
   students who ultimately enrolled in a programme.Practical
   implicationsBeyond student recruitment, the system supports strategic
   planning, resource allocation and the development of teaching and
   learning accommodations. By analysing trends in students' background
   information, universities can better align their offerings with the
   needs and preferences of incoming cohorts.Originality/valueThis study
   introduces a novel multi-model analytics approach to support student
   admission and enrolment. The system's predictive capabilities and
   visualisation tools offer a scalable solution for enhancing
   institutional decision-making and operational efficiency.},

Abstract = {Online programs risk higher student dropout rates. Supporting learning
   tools such as learning analytics dashboards (LADs) can promote
   self-regulated learning and positively impact student outcomes. In this
   paper, a three-level design study is presented that demonstrates the
   reduction of cognitive load at multiple levels when students are
   involved in the LAD design process. Through a user-centered design
   process (including requirements analysis and expert interviews), a
   wire-frame was developed using participatory methods and evaluated by 24
   university students using the laws of Gestalt psychology, resulting in a
   clickable, low-fidelity prototype (LFD). This was then evaluated by 24
   university students using the interaction principles of EN ISO
   9241-110:2020. The refined LFD was further evaluated with university
   students in an eye-tracking study using the thinking-aloud technique (n
   = 10). The feedback emphasized the importance of participatory design
   and provided critical insights into the most effective use of the LAD
   and its elements, taking into account cognitive aspects. The results
   showed significant optimization in the small details and the big picture
   in the use of content elements, e.g., it is a crucial part to create a
   navigation structure adapted to the needs of an LAD and it is beneficial
   to present a reduced level of information during the initial access,
   with the option to add or access additional elements as needed.},

Title = {Designing data-informed support for building learning habits in the
   Japanese K12 context},
Journal = {RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN TECHNOLOGY ENHANCED LEARNING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {While building proper learning habits has been said to enhance academic
   performance, it is challenging to give long-term support for building
   habits in educational contexts due to the lack of continuous tracing of
   one's habitual behaviors. With the accumulation of learning logs and the
   advancement of Learning Analytics (LA) techniques, this paper
   illustrates the data-informed support for building learning habits,
   which involves persuading one to change behaviors. Specifically, we
   tackled 2 research objectives following the Persuasive Systems Design
   (PSD) model. First, we defined indicators of learning habits from log
   data and analyzed 115,340 learning logs of 96 learners from a Japanese
   junior high school. As a result, the learners' types of habits could be
   detected even though some might not be efficient and the stages of
   habits fluctuated over time. We also identified differences when
   comparing the learning habits extracted from the log data with those
   reported in the questionnaire. Second, based on the understanding of the
   learner profiles, we designed elements of an LA dashboard to support
   habit-building by applying the design principles from the PSD model.
   Overall, the learners recognized the feasibility of integrating
   data-informed support into their daily learning. Therefore, we look
   forward to the evidence of its effectiveness on the behavior change that
   can be depicted by the transition between stages of different types of
   learning habits.},

Abstract = {Work throughout the learning analytics community has examined
   associations between Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD) features and a
   number of important student outcomes, including academic motivation and
   self-regulated learning strategies. While there are many potential
   implications of visualized academic information within a LAD on student
   outcomes, there remains an unanswered question: are there causal
   differences between showing performance information (e.g., comparing
   students' progress to the class average) vs. mastery information (e.g.,
   their individual score) on students' motivation?
   Grounded in Achievement Goal Theory, this study answers this question
   experimentally by analyzing the difference between college students'
   (n=445) reported achievement goal orientations as well as their
   motivated information seeking orientations after being presented with
   performance or mastery feedback. Results indicate that students in a
   performance condition which displayed ``above average{''} achievement on
   an academic measure reported lower performance-avoidance goals (e.g.,
   not wanting to do worse than everyone else), and performance-avoidance
   information-seeking goals (e.g., not wanting to seek out information
   showing that one does worse than peers) when compared to students in the
   mastery control condition.
   This study contributes to our understanding of the motivational
   implications of academic feedback presented to students, and suggests
   that comparative information has direct effects on student motivation.
   Results thus uncover a potential tension between what might seem
   intuitive feedback to give students versus what might be more
   motivationally appropriate. The implications of this work point to the
   need to understand LADs not simply as feedback mechanisms, but as
   embedded features of a learning environment that influence how students
   engage with course content.},

   reconfigure roles, risk and sociality in education},
Journal = {BIG DATA \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we explore how the development and affordances of
   predictive analytics may impact how teachers and other educational
   actors think about and teach students and, more broadly, how society
   understands education. Our particular focus is on the data dashboards of
   learning support systems which are based on Machine Learning (ML). While
   previous research has focused on how these systems produce credible
   knowledge, we explore here how they also produce compelling, persuasive
   and convincing narratives. Our main argument is that particular kinds of
   stories are written by predictive analytics and written into their data
   dashboards. Based on a case study of a leading predictive analytics
   system, we explore how data dashboards imply causality between the
   `facts' they are visualising. To do so, we analyse the stories they tell
   according to their spatial and temporal dimensions, characters and
   events, sequentiality as well as tellability. In the stories we
   identify, teachers are managers, students are at greater or lesser risk,
   and students' sociality is reduced to machine-readable interactions.
   Overall, only data marked as individual behaviours becomes relevant to
   the system, rendering structural inequalities invisible. Reflecting on
   the implications of these systems, we suggest ways in which the uptake
   of these systems can interrupt such stories and reshape them in other
   directions.},

   aims here as a secure, moderated communication model with a
   resource-sharing mechanism. It uses role-based access control to enhance
   information sharing and promote effective discussions in professional
   learning settings. Share Spell model here is for users to post and
   manage content within predefined categories, participate in discussions,
   and report inappropriate content, while administrators manage user
   access, categories, and reported content through a comprehensive
   dashboard.
   This work contributes to the development process of Massive online open
   courses for self-paced learners. The collaborative nature of MOOCs
   (Massive Open Online Courses), and ability to simulate professional
   environments to enhance communication and knowledge sharing among
   learners. The proposed model enhances learner performance, contributing
   to their success and growth using discussion forums. The prototype
   accommodates diverse learning styles, encourages professional behavior,

Abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards have been developed to facilitate teacher
   guidance in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). As yet,
   little is known about how teachers interpret dashboard information to
   facilitate guidance in their teaching practice. This study examined
   teachers' behavior patterns in interpreting information from dashboards,
   and obtained their views about the potential barriers in interpreting
   dashboard information. Fourteen pre-service teachers participated in the
   study and data were collected from multiple sources. In total, 1,346 min
   of video data on teachers' guiding behavior and approximately 27,000
   words from a cued retrospective report and interview data were
   generated. A two-stage approach was adopted to process the data. Based
   on the video analysis in the first stage, we extracted teachers' four
   typical behavior patterns in finding and reading dashboard information
   and two behavior patterns when explaining information from dashboards.
   Thematic analysis at the second stage identified useful indicators for
   teacher guidance in CSCL and some major barriers teachers encountered in
   interpreting information. These findings may help improve the design of
   dashboards and show how teachers integrate dashboards into their daily
   teaching practice, thereby enhancing students' collaboration and
   learning.},

Abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) applications to support human tutoring have
   potential to significantly improve learning outcomes, but engagement
   issues persist, especially among students from lowincome backgrounds. We
   introduce an AI-assisted tutoring model that combines human and AI
   tutoring and hypothesize this synergy will have positive impacts on
   learning processes. To investigate this hypothesis, we conduct a
   three-study quasi-experiment across three urban and low-income middle
   schools: 1) 125 students in a Pennsylvania school; 2) 385 students (50\%
   Latinx) in a California school, and 3) 75 students (100\% Black) in a
   Pennsylvania charter school, all implementing analogous tutoring models.
   We compare learning analytics of students engaged in human-AI tutoring
   compared to students using math software only. We find human-AI tutoring
   has positive effects, particularly in student ` s proficiency and usage,
   with evidence suggesting lower achieving students may benefit more
   compared to higher achieving students. We illustrate the use of
   quasi-experimental methods adapted to the particulars of different
   schools and data-availability contexts so as to achieve the rapid
   data-driven iteration needed to guide an inspired creation into
   effective innovation. Future work focuses on improving the tutor
   dashboard and optimizing tutor-student ratios, while maintaining annual
   costs per student of approximately \$700 annually.},

Abstract = {Emerge of new technologies such as mobile devices, social media,
   gamification and learning analytics using big data have opened up
   solutions to meet the increased demand of personalized learning in the
   21st century European classroom (Fizgerald et al., 2013). Yet many
   challenges remain, particularly in topics of science, technology,
   engineering and mathematics (STEM)(Bybee, 2010). Students are
   unmotivated to head for STEM careers where professionals are
   increasingly needed (Harackiewicz et al., 2012). Future learning
   environments should be able to support personalized, tailored solutions
   for all students (Santos et al., 2014). Costs and risks of early school
   leavers are a global societal challenge, in which the emerge of new
   learning technologies, could have a direct impact upon.
   Technology-supported PLEs have been developed over the last few decades
   to increase students' motivation and support individual learning paths
   suitable for each student's learning styles (Felder \& Spurlin, 2005)
   and preferences. Fast developing technologies propose a challenge also
   for teachers who lack both the time and the competences (Clements \&
   Pawlowski, 2012) to make use of these technologies.
   In this research we first investigated the PLE state-of-the-art through
   literature review. We then tackled the question of what should the
   future's personal learning environments for STEM be like. Through a
   pre-commercial procurement (PCP) method we prepared PCP based on the
   literature review, as well as invitation to tender for which 11 complete
   PLE service offers were received. Those offers were then the evaluated
   and analyzed for the technical and pedagogical functionalities with a
   panel of teachers from four countries in Europe (Finland, Sweden,
   Germany and Spain) as well as three specifically chosen external experts
   (technical, pedagogical and STEM). 65-point criteria rising from the
   literature review was used for this.
   The analysis of the evaluation panel show that the state-of-the-art in
   PLEs is still far behind of more commercial fields such as retail
   industry or social media solutions. Smart use of learning analytics can
   solve many of these challenges. Users expect the system to read their
   minds and guide them to the support they need, whether it is learning
   style tailored content, or smart solutions for peer support within their
   own classrooms. Teachers should be able to evaluate entire classrooms of
   students within one dashboard. The current state-of-the-art in PLEs
   unfortunately uses very little of the possibilities learning analytics
   could provide: Often the systems tend to only measure user behavior
   instead of actual learning.
   Our findings also show that users should be involved early into the PLE
   design process and testing should be conducted in real classrooms.
   Overall the dialogue between demand and supply side throughout the
   development is the key to the PCP's success. The contribution of this
   study is a trend guideline for PLE stakeholders, which could be
   specifically be used in designing improved learning solutions. This work
   has been conducted in within European Union co-funded IMAILE project.},

   contribution of this article is qualitative and quantitative evidence
   from two studies evaluating a multimodal teamwork analytics tool in
   authentic clinical teamwork simulations. Collocated activity data are
   rendered to help nursing students reflect on errors and stress-related
   incidents during simulations. The user interface explicitly guides
   student reflection using data storytelling principles, tuned to the
   intended learning outcomes. The results demonstrate the potential of
   interfaces that ``tell one data story at a time,{''} by helping students
   to identify misconceptions and errors; think about strategies they might
   use to address errors, and reflect on their arousal levels. The results
   also illuminate broader issues around automated formative assessment,
   and the intelligibility and accountability of learning analytics.},

Abstract = {The role of social media in higher education has shifted from providing
   a web 2.0 solution for supporting communication in computer supported
   learning to more advanced functionalities including virtual learning
   environment tools (e.g. content sharing, threaded discussions). This
   paper discusses how social media data analysis can equip tutors with
   visual probes for certain areas that may need attention. The paper also
   describes how data mining can be used for assessing the source of
   communication patterns in computer supported collaborative (e.g. issues
   associated with content, learning activities or student competencies).
   The paper attempts to identify certain metrics for the production of a
   learning analytics dashboard. Current work presented in the paper
   includes the statistical analysis of communication data between 24
   student groups and 66 student pairs from a cohort of more than 120 final
   year students studying information systems. The data collected from
   Facebook, Twitter and Linked in have been analysed with the use of
   NodeXL, demonstrating group cohesion, communication pattern, student
   interactions and frequency of message exchanges.
   Emphasis was given on investigating the total tweets, Facebook posts and
   LinkedIn projects submitted by students over a period of 24 learning
   weeks over 7-8 months. The scope of the analysis was to assess how
   different learning tasks affected individual and group contributions as
   well as the impact of specific learning activities on tasks such as
   commenting, sharing, linking and liking. The investigation also
   considered how keywords were used, indicating how social media
   interaction was affected by the subjects covered during specific
   learning weeks.
   The authors also present the use of data mining techniques for
   identifying which metric best predicts the student's results in terms of
   engagement, involvement, participation, contribution and communication.
   These are some of the factors that may affect the learning experience
   when integrating Web 2.0 technologies with traditional virtual learning
   environments. Current work discussed in the paper also attempts to use
   time series data, to test which metrics can predict the student's
   results in real time (i.e. identifying those students who are likely to
   fail or need additional support), as well as ways to analyse social
   media metrics and suggestions for further work towards implement
   learning analytics dashboards.},

Abstract = {A smart learning environment is characterized by the key provision of
   personalized learning experiences. To approach different degrees of
   personalization in online learning, this article introduces a framework
   called Smart Competence Analytics in LEarning (SCALE) that tracks
   finer-level learning experiences and translates them into opportunities
   for customized feedback, reflection, and regulation. The SCALE framework
   is implemented in four layers: the sensing layer, the analysis layer,
   the competence layer, and the visualization layer. The sensing layer
   provides the datasets to support context-awareness through
   state-of-the-art sensing technologies. The analysis layer, by the means
   of powerful code analysis tools, derives performance metrics (e.g.,
   learner coding metrics) which serve as input to the competence layer to
   identify proficiency levels of learners. Finally, a learning analytics
   dashboard called MI-DASH (visualization layer) allows interaction with
   performance and competence metrics. The current SCALE system has been
   used in a study to track the habits, performances, and competences of
   novice programmers. Growth of coding competences of first-year
   engineering students has been captured in a continuous manner. Students
   have been provided with customized feedback to optimize their learning
   paths. The article describes the analytics-based approach pursued in the
   study and highlights key findings.},

Title = {Understanding students? engagement with a Serious Game to learn English:
   A sociocultural perspective},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Research studies have demonstrated that students' sociocultural
   background influences their learning and engagement processes in
   classroom activities. Additionally, research studies have shown
   inconclusive effects of how Serious Games improve students' engagement.
   Therefore, this article describes the results of a research study that
   analyzed, from a sociocultural perspective, the incorporation of the
   Serious Game (SG) Be (the) 1: Challenge in a classroom setting with
   forty-seven high school students who live in vulnerable conditions in
   the Amazonian region of Colombia. A revised version of the Motivation
   Attitude Knowledge Engagement (MAKE) survey was implemented to inquire
   students' engagement with the game, including open-ending questions.
   Moreover, game learning analytics (GLA) from a teachers' dashboard was
   collected to track students' achievements and progress during gameplay.
   Data was analyzed, triangulated, and interpreted through the lenses of
   the Reflective Play Activity Model (RPAM) to have a better understanding
   of students' interactions with the game in the classroom. The main
   findings reveal that (1) when students developed intrinsic play, their
   cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement was low, but when they
   developed extrinsic play, their engagement increased, and (2) GLA serves
   to predict students' engagement with a SG in marginalized settings.
   Additionally, this study refines the RPAM by deepening how this model
   can occur in face-to-face settings with students who, due to their
   sociocultural background, do not have access to discuss, construct,
   exchange, and share information about game features in online
   environments.},

Abstract = {Purpose Managing efficiently educational Big Data, produced by Virtual
   Learning Environments, is becoming a compelling necessity, especially
   for those universities providing distance learning. This paper aims to
   propose a possible framework to compute efficiently key performance
   indicators, summarizing the trends of students' academic careers, by
   using educational Big Data. Design/methodology/approach The framework is
   designed and implemented in a distributed fashion. The parallel
   computation of the indicators through Map and Reduce nodes is carefully
   described, together with the workflow of data, from the educational
   sources to a NoSQL database and to the learning analytics engine.
   Findings This framework was tested at eCampus University, an Italian
   distance learning institution, and it was able to significantly reduce
   the amount of time needed to compute key performance indicators.
   Moreover, by implementing a proper data representation dashboard, it
   resulted in a useful help and support for educational decisions and
   performance analyses and for revealing possible criticalities.
   Originality/value The framework proposed integrates for the first time,
   to the best of the authors' knowledge, a set of modules, designed and
   implemented in a distributed fashion, to compute key performance
   indicators for distance learning institutions. It can be used to analyze
   the dropouts and the outcomes of students and, therefore, to evaluate
   the performances of universities, which can, in turn, propose effective
   improvements toward enhancing the overall e-learning scenario.},

Title = {Educational Effects on the Transparency of Peer Participation Levels in
   Asynchronous Online Discussion Activities},

Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Participation dashboards in online discussions are learning support
   tools that can have a positive effect on learners' learning outcomes and
   satisfaction levels, but their effectiveness differs according to how
   learners recognize and interpret them. However, there is a lack of
   research investigating the effectiveness of visualization methods
   regarding learners' participation levels. Accordingly, in this study,
   two visualization methods are applied to participation dashboards to
   show peer participation levels and to support online discussion
   activities. The Transparent Participation Dashboard (TPD) provides the
   exact participation levels for all learners who participate in an online
   discussion, whereas the Private Participation Dashboard (PPD) visualizes
   a learner's relative level of participation in comparison to the average
   value of a class. This study aimed to compare the effects of these two
   types of participation dashboards on the behavioral, cognitive, and
   affective aspects of online discussion activities. Toward this end, we
   conducted an experimental study. The participants included 62
   undergraduate students who were randomly assigned to two groups.
   Thirty-two students were assigned to the Transparent group, which
   received the TPD. Thirty students were assigned to the Private group,
   which received the PPD. Our findings showed no significant difference in
   usability, quality of discussions, or learning outcomes between the two
   groups. However, the Transparent group was more active in its online
   discussions and expressed more negative satisfaction with the dashboard.
   This study's conclusions suggest that dashboards for promoting learner
   competitiveness can positively affect learners' behavioral aspects but
   they may negatively impact their emotions.},

Title = {Exploring the Irish general practice training community's perceptions on

Abstract = {BackgroundThe Irish General Practitioner Training (GP) Programme is
   currently moving to Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME),
   facilitated by Programmatic Assessment (PA) and Entrustable Professional
   Activities (EPAs). These new assessment and feedback mechanisms may
   provide a rich and much sought-after dataset. However, given the
   possible number of feedback and assessment events, and the variety of
   modalities used, aggregating and interpreting these can be costly and
   difficult. Dashboard implementations (DI) have been purposed as a
   solution to bridge the gap between the large datasets and the training
   community at all levels.AimsTo explore the Irish GP training community's
   perceptions on how an EPAs DI could facilitate the delivery of GP
   training in Ireland.MethodsA qualitative approach was taken, using a
   focus group representative of different groups in the training
   community. Concurrently, an EPAs DI was developed. Focus group
   transcripts were analysed in an iterative fashion using Template
   Analysis to generate themes and subthemes.ResultsNumerous advantages
   were seen in relation to the implementation of an EPAs DI around
   entrustment decisions, constructive alignment and summative
   decision-making. These advantages, however, need to be tempered with the
   realisation that the EPAs DI is not and should not be misinterpreted as
   being the learning analytic panacea for GP training.ConclusionThis paper
   outlines the perceptions from a postgraduate medical education training
   community on an EPAs DI, which would be applicable to other training
   communities considering introducing similar mechanisms.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an analytics platform that has been developed for
   designers and teachers who build and use interactive e-books for

   them taking into account both the overall learning design and the data
   from their usage. This paper presents architectural and design decisions
   on key features of the dashboard, and the evaluation of a high-fidelity
   prototype. We discuss findings related to use of the dashboard for
   exploratory data analysis and inquiry and how these generalise and can

Title = {The effects of visualisation literacy and data storytelling dashboards
   on teachers' load},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {78-93},
Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) dashboards are becoming increasingly available
   in various learning settings. However, teachers may face challenges in
   understanding and interpreting the data visualisations presented on
   those dashboards. In response to this, some LA researchers are
   incorporating visual cueing techniques, like data storytelling (DS),
   into LA dashboard design to reduce the data visualisation skills - often
   referred to as visualisation literacy (VL) - and cognitive effort
   required by teachers to effectively use dashboards. However, despite the
   potential of DS principles in simplifying data visualisations, there is
   limited evidence supporting their effectiveness in actually reducing
   teachers' cognitive load. The study presented in this paper addresses
   this gap by investigating the potential impact of LA dashboards, with
   and without DS elements, on teachers with varying VL levels. Through a
   quasi -experimental study involving 23 teachers, we analysed changes in
   pupil dilation - a proxy for cognitive load - as they examined LA
   dashboards featuring student data captured while participating in
   synchronous, online collaborative learning tasks. Our findings suggest
   DS can reduce cognitive load, particularly for teachers with lower VL.
   These results provide insight into the effects of DS and VL on teachers'
   cognitive load, thereby informing the design of LA dashboards.
   Implications for practice or policy: center dot Developers of LA
   dashboards need to pay more attention to incorporating visual and
   narrative elements that are easily comprehensible and target -oriented,
   based on users' visualisation literacy levels. center dot Educational
   providers and LA designers can recommend dashboards with DS elements to
   teachers with low VL to enhance their work efficiency.},

Title = {Design and usability testing of an in-house developed performance
   feedback tool for medical students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 23},
Abstract = {Background Feedback is essential in a self-regulated learning
   environment such as medical education. When feedback channels are widely
   spread, the need arises for a system of integrating this information in
   a single platform. This article reports on the design and initial
   testing of a feedback tool for medical students at
   Charite-Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, a large teaching hospital.
   Following a needs analysis, we designed and programmed a feedback tool
   in a user-centered approach. The resulting interface was evaluated prior
   to release with usability testing and again post release using
   quantitative/qualitative questionnaires. Results The tool we created is
   a browser application for use on desktop or mobile devices. Students log
   in to see a dashboard of ``cards{''} featuring summaries of assessment
   results, a portal for the documentation of acquired practical skills,
   and an overview of their progress along their course. Users see their
   cohort's average for each format. Learning analytics rank students'
   strengths by subject. The interface is characterized by colourful and
   simple graphics. In its initial form, the tool has been rated positively
   overall by students. During testing, the high task completion rate
   (78\%) and low overall number of non-critical errors indicated good
   usability, while the quantitative data (system usability scoring) also
   indicates high ease of use. The source code for the tool is open-source
   and can be adapted by other medical faculties. Conclusions The results
   suggest that the implemented tool LevelUp is well-accepted by students.
   It therefore holds promise for improved, digitalized integrated feedback
   about students' learning progress. Our aim is that LevelUp will help
   medical students to keep track of their study progress and reflect on
   their skills. Further development will integrate users' recommendations
   for additional features as well as optimizing data flow.},

Abstract = {Data-driven dashboards have been increasingly integrated into various
   contexts, particularly in educational settings. There is a growing need
   to understand how to design learning dashboards to help educators
   support learning experiences by providing real-time formative feedback.
   We are studying the design of a learning dashboard that can support
   educational facilitation tasks in a museum setting. In our approach, we
   use discrete facilitation tasks as the cornerstone of our design
   process. Using this task-based approach, we conducted pilot studies and
   participatory design sessions to better understand the context of
   design. In this paper, we offer preliminary findings and design
   considerations for supporting and digitally augmenting facilitation
   tasks in a highly interactive, open-ended learning environment.},

Abstract = {Under the notion of ``CSCL scripts{''}, different pedagogical models for
   structuring and supporting collaboration in the classroom have been
   proposed. We report on a practical experience with scripts based on the
   Pyramid collaborative learning flow pattern supported by a specific
   classroom tool and a teacher-facing dashboard that implements mirroring
   and guiding support. The input data of our analysis stems from
   recordings of classroom interactions guided by several teachers using
   the PyramidApp with different levels of teaching support. For the
   analysis, we introduce a specific coding scheme enabling a quantitative
   comparison and deeper analysis using epistemic network analysis. The
   results show that the guiding support enabled teachers to perform more
   orchestration actions, more targeted interactions and to make more
   announcements to the class (regarding time, phase transitions, and
   students' activity participation) when compared to the mirroring
   support. Teachers' actionable differences observed under the mirroring
   and guiding support directed us to deconstruct the notion of
   orchestration load into different facets and to discuss how different
   support provisions correspond to the different facets of orchestration
   load.},

Title = {Introduction to the SRL-S Rubric for Evaluation of Innovative Higher
   Educational Technology for Self-Regulated Learning},
Journal = {INNOVATIVE HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 20},
Abstract = {The integration of advanced learning analytics and data-mining
   technology into higher education has brought various opportunities and
   challenges, particularly in enhancing students' self-regulated learning
   (SRL) skills. Analyzing developed features for SRL support, it has
   become evident that SRL support is not a binary concept but rather a
   continuum, ranging from limited to advanced levels of SRL support. This
   article introduces the rubric, designed to evaluate the degree of
   self-regulated learning support available within technology enhanced
   learning environments. Following rubric design best practices, we took a
   multifaceted methodological approach to ensure rubric validity and
   reliability: consulting Zimmerman's theoretical model, comparing
   technological features distilled from empirical studies that
   demonstrated significant effectiveness, consulting SRL experts, and
   iterative development and feedback. Across three phases of SRL the
   rubrics describe evaluation criteria and in detail define performance
   levels (Limited, Moderate and Advance). By employing the rubric,
   educators and researchers can 1) gain insights into the extent of
   implemented SRL approaches, 2) further develop SRL support of learning
   environments, and 3) better support students on their journey towards
   becoming self-regulated learners. Finally, the reliability analysis
   demonstrated a high degree of agreement among different raters
   evaluating the same course, indicating that the rubric is a reliable
   tool for obtaining relevant evaluations of SRL support in higher
   education. We conclude by discussing the significance of the rubric in
   promoting self-regulated learning within the current pedagogical and
   technological landscape.},

Abstract = {Learning Management Systems are web-based systems in which learners can
   interact with content/learning resources and assessments, as well as
   other learners and instructors. LMSs have been widely used especially
   since the beginning of the information age. In the context of this
   study, the aim was to determine the expectations and needs of the
   learners, who are considered to be one of the most important
   stakeholders of the LMSs. An open-ended questionnaire and a
   semi-structured interview form prepared by the researchers were used as
   data collection tools. Content analysis was performed to analyze
   open-ended questions and interview data. According to the findings it
   was seen that learners want more entertaining and self-monitoring
   environments, especially with the elements of gamification. It was also
   seen that the learning environments have reporting and predictive
   capability on student achievement. Learners' needs and expectations
   match with third-generation learning management systems. The
   third-generation learning management systems can be developed through
   educational data mining and learning analytics. Within the scope of this
   research, the learner expectations and needs were discussed in the
   context of the third generation learning management systems,
   intervention and types of intervention.},

Abstract = {In large class settings, individualized student-teacher interaction is
   difficult. However, teaching interactions (e.g., formative feedback) are
   central to encouraging deep approaches to learning. While there has been
   progress in automatic short-answer grading, analysing student responses
   to support formative feedback at scale is arguably some way from being
   widely applied in practice. However, analysing student written responses
   can provide insights into student conceptions, thus directly informing
   teacher actions. Indeed, we argue that analysing student responses to
   provide feedback directly to teachers is as worthy a goal as providing
   individualized feedback to students and is achievable given the current
   state-of-the-art in natural language processing. In this paper, we
   analyse student written responses to short-answer questions posed in the
   context of a large first year health sciences course. Each question was
   designed to elicit deep responses. Our qualitative analysis illustrates
   the variability in student responses and reveals multiple relationships
   between these responses, course materials and the questions posed. Such
   information can be invaluable for teacher praxis. We conclude with a
   conceptual dashboard' that categorizes student responses and reveals
   relationships between responses, course resources and the questions.
   Such a dashboard could provide timely, actionable insights for teachers
   and help foster deep learning approaches for students.},

Title = {A multimodal approach to support teacher, researcher and AI

Abstract = {Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and
   multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) have allowed for new and creative
   ways of leveraging AI to support K12 students' collaborative learning in
   STEM+C domains. To date, there is little evidence of AI methods
   supporting students' collaboration in complex, open-ended environments.
   AI systems are known to underperform humans in (1) interpreting
   students' emotions in learning contexts, (2) grasping the nuances of
   social interactions and (3) understanding domain-specific information
   that was not well-represented in the training data. As such, combined
   human and AI (ie, hybrid) approaches are needed to overcome the current
   limitations of AI sys-tems. In this paper, we take a first step towards
   investigating how a human-AI collaboration between teachers and
   researchers using an AI-generated mul-timodal timeline can guide and
   support teachers' feed-back while addressing students' STEM+C
   difficulties as they work collaboratively to build computational models
   and solve problems. In doing so, we present a framework characterizing
   the human component of our human-AI partnership as a collaboration
   between teachers and researchers. To evaluate our approach, we present
   our timeline to a high school teacher and discuss the key insights
   gleaned from our dis-cussions. Our case study analysis reveals the
   effectiveness of an iterative approach to using human-AI collaboration
   to address students' STEM+C chal-lenges: the teacher can use the
   AI-generated time-line to guide formative feedback for students, and the
   researchers can leverage the teacher's feedback to help improve the
   multimodal timeline. Additionally, we characterize our findings with
   respect to two events of interest to the teacher: (1) when the students
   cross a difficulty threshold, and (2) the point of intervention, that
   is, when the teacher (or system) should intervene to provide effective
   feedback. It is important to note that the teacher explained that there
   should be a lag between (1) and (2) to give students a chance to
   re-solve their own difficulties. Typically, such a lag is not
   implemented in computer-based learning environ-ments that provide
   feedback.},

Abstract = {This study aims to contribute to empirical and interdisciplinary
   knowledge on how visual learning analytics tools can support students'
   cognitive engagement in complex in-class scenarios. Taking a holistic
   approach, instructional design, learning analytics, and students'
   perceptions were examined together. The teaching of systematic viewing
   and image interpretation in radiology education was used to exemplify a
   complex in-class scenario, and a specific learning dashboard was
   designed as a support tool. The design was based on both educational and
   visualization theories and aligned with a pedagogical scenario
   integrating individual and class-wide activities. The quantity and
   quality of the cognitive engagement of a group of 26 students were
   explored. A mixed method approach was used, including computer log file
   analyses of individual work, analysis of video recordings of in-class
   small group discussions, and a focus group discussion with the students
   involved. The in-class scenario with the learning dashboard resulted in
   a good balance between individual tasks and group discussions and a high
   degree of active cognitive engagement. Constructive and interactive
   forms of cognitive engagement were, however, less evident. In addition,
   the products of these constructive (description of findings) and
   interactive (type of dialogue) cognitive engagements were of mediocre
   quality and therefore not optimal for knowledge transfer. The study also
   showed that the way the students and teacher understood their respective
   tasks and used the available interaction techniques of the learning
   dashboard highly influenced the students' cognitive engagement. Finally,
   several ideas emerged that could help to overcome the deficits found in
   the training of participants and to improve the tasks set and the
   learning dashboard itself.},

   due to the pandemic. This study follows the Group Learning Orchestration
   Based on Evidence (GLOBE) framework that considers four phases of
   technology-supported group work and proposes data-driven services for
   each phase. In this paper, we present an analysis tool named ``GWpulse''
   that processes learning log data and shares the analysis results as an
   attribute of the learner model considered in GLOBE and also presents it
   in the group work dashboard to facilitate group awareness. In the
   current version GWpulse considered logs of forum activity generated
   during group activities in the learning management system. Apart from
   including that data in the learner model, it also visualizes the
   activity data for the orchestration, evaluation and reflection phases.
   GWpulse dashboard displays the basic statistics of their students' forum
   activities such as time interval and the number of posts, as well as a
   novel indicator of ``Assistance Needed Level{''} calculated using
   sentiment analysis method that classifies textual statements into
   positive and negative.},

Abstract = {In this research we propose a comprehensive set of knowledge indicators
   aimed to enhance learners' self-reflection and awareness in the learning
   and testing process. Since examined intelligent tutoring systems do not
   include additional messaging features, the introduction of common set of
   knowledge indicators differentiates our approach from the previous
   studies. In order to investigate the relation between proposed knowledge
   indicators and learner performance, the correlation and regression
   analysis were performed for 3 different courses and each examined
   intelligent tutoring system. The results of correlation and regression
   analysis, as well as learners' feedback, guided us in discussion about
   the introduction of knowledge indicators in dashboard-like
   visualizations of integrated intelligent tutoring system.},

   representative library users are compared to the whole student
   population, to explore how library services contribute to student
   success, and to position the library to be included in the institution's

   students at University of Central Florida (n = 25,336) interacted with
   five library service points over four semesters. Analysis revealed a
   positive association between students who used one or more library
   services and higher end-of-semester GPAs. The article emphasizes how
   results were disseminated and ongoing work to build an interactive
   learning analytics library dashboard that complements existing
   institutional dashboards.},

Abstract = {Information dashboards are increasing their sophistication to match new
   necessities and adapt to the high quantities of generated data nowadays.
   These tools support visual analysis, knowledge generation, and thus, are
   crucial systems to assist decision-making processes. However, the design
   and development processes are complex, because several perspectives and
   components can be involved. Tailoring capabilities are focused on
   providing individualized dashboards without affecting the time-to-market
   through the decrease of the development processes' time. Among the
   methods used to configure these tools, the software product lines
   paradigm and model-driven development can be found. These paradigms
   benefit from the study of the target domain and the abstraction of
   features, obtaining high-level models that can be instantiated into
   concrete models. This paper presents a dashboard meta-model that aims to
   be applicable to any dashboard. Through domain engineering, different
   features of these tools are identified and arranged into abstract
   structures and relationships to gain a better understanding of the
   domain. The goal of the meta-model is to obtain a framework for
   instantiating any dashboard to adapt them to different contexts and user
   profiles. One of the contexts in which dashboards are gaining relevance
   is Learning Analytics, as learning dashboards are powerful tools for
   assisting teachers and students in their learning activities. To
   illustrate the instantiation process of the presented meta-model, a
   small example within this relevant context (Learning Analytics) is also
   provided.},

   analytics based dashboard feedback and learning theories by grounding
   the idea of dashboard feedback onto learning science concepts such as
   feedback, learning goals, (socio-/meta-) cognitive mechanisms underlying
   learning processes. This work extends the earlier research by proposing
   mechanisms for making those concepts and relationships measurable. The
   outcome is a complementary framework that allows identifying feedback
   needs and timing for their provision in a generic context that can be
   applied to a certain subject in a given LMS. The research serves as
   general guidelines for educators in designing educational dashboards, as
   well as a starting research platform in the direction of systematically
   matching learning sciences concepts with data and analytics concepts.},

Abstract = {Even though the recent influx of tablets in primary education goes
   together with the vision that educational technologies will
   revolutionize education, empirical results supporting this claim are
   scarce. The adaptive educational technology in this research is used
   daily in primary classrooms and includes teacher dashboards. While
   students practice on the tablet, the technology displays real-time data
   of learner progress and performance in teacher dashboards. This study
   examines how teachers use the dashboards during lessons applying the
   Verberts' learning analytic process model. Teacher dashboard
   consultations and resulting pedagogical actions were observed in
   mathematics lessons. In a following stimulated recall interview, a
   teacher was asked to elaborate on the knowledge he/she activated and
   his/her reasoning in interpreting the dashboard. The results indicate
   that teachers consult the dashboard on average 8,3 times per lesson, but
   great variation among teachers was found. Teachers activate existing
   knowledge about the class and students to interpret dashboard data. The
   pedagogical actions teachers take after dashboard consultation are
   mainly providing individual feedback and additional instruction. The
   results show that pedagogical actions preformed at teachers' own
   initiative are mostly directed to low ability students, whereas actions
   after consulting the dashboard are more directed at middle and high
   ability students. These results indicate that extracted learning
   analytics, in the form of teacher dashboards are indeed influencing
   teachers' pedagogical actions in daily classroom activities and may
   initiate behavior changes in teaching practices.},

   activity, it aims at learning byte-sized contents. The research
   initiates a design of LA-ReflecT, a platform for conducting
   micro-learning activities with a data-informed reflection cycle.
   Activities can have multiple short tasks which can have different
   multimedia and interaction elements. User interactions are logged in
   standardized xAPI format. Processed logs are presented in a dashboard to
   enable student's in-activity reflection. We present an initial draw
   implications of standardized interaction tracking that the application
   enables for further research on an embodied narrative of learning.},

   and resources that enhance creative thinking for both designers
   (authors) and learners. The learning material is expected to offer
   learners opportunities to engage creatively with mathematical problems
   and develop creative mathematical thinking. The analytics dashboard is
   designed to increase authors' awareness so that they can make informed
   decisions on how to redesign and improve the e-books. This paper
   presents architectural and design decisions on key features of the
   dashboard and discusses future steps with respect to the potential for

Abstract = {Teachers play an essential role during collaborative learning. To
   provide effective support, teachers have to be constantly aware of
   students' activities and make fast decisions about which group to offer
   support, without disrupting students' collaborative process. Teacher
   dashboards are visual displays that provide analytics about learners to
   help teachers increase their awareness of the situation. However, if
   teachers are not able to efficiently and effectively distill information
   from the dashboard, the dashboard can become an obstacle instead of an
   aid. In the present study, we compared dashboards that provide
   information (mirroring) to dashboards that provide information and alert
   the teacher to groups that are in need of support (advising). Teachers
   were shown standardized, fictitious collaborative situations on one of
   the types of dashboards and were asked to detect the group that was in
   need of support. The results showed that teachers in the advising
   condition more often detected the problematic group, needed less effort
   to do so, and were more confident of their decisions. The
   teacher-dashboard interaction patterns showed that teachers in the
   advising condition generally started by checking the given alert, but
   also that they tried to look at as much information about other groups
   as they could. In the mirroring condition, teachers generally started by
   examining information from class overviews, but did not always have time
   to check information for individual groups. These findings are discussed
   in light of the role of a teacher dashboard in teachers' decision making
   in the context of student collaboration.},

Abstract = {Keeping K-12 teachers engaged during students' learning and problem
   solving in technology-enhanced, integrated problem-based learning (PBL)
   has been shown to support deeper student involvement, and, therefore,
   better success learning difficult science, computing, and engineering
   concepts and practices. However, students' learning processes and
   corresponding difficulties are not easily noticed by teachers as
   students learn from these environments as processes are captured through
   mouse clicks, drag and drop actions, and other low-level activities. As
   such, teachers find it difficult to set up meaningful interactions with
   students while also maintaining the focus on student-centered learning.
   Little research has examined dashboard-supported responsive teaching
   practices for K-12 PBL. This study examined 8 teachers as they used a
   co-designed teacher dashboard to assess and respond to students'
   learning and strategies during an integrated, PBL STEM curriculum.
   Teachers completed a series of 5 ``planning period simulations{''}
   leveraging the dashboard and think-aloud protocols were implemented,
   supported by semi-structured interview questions, to enable the teachers
   to verbalize their thought and evaluation processes. Content analysis
   and epistemic network analysis were conducted to analyze the
   simulations. Understanding how teachers use dashboards to support
   evidence-based teaching practices during technology-enhanced curricula
   is critical for improving teacher support and preparation.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a system that defines and visualises learners'
   understanding of lecture content based on learning data obtained from
   the digital textbook system, Smart E-textbook Application (SEA), and a
   quiz function. By feedbacking the visualised results to the learner, the
   system allows the learner to know which units of the lecture need a
   review. This enables the learner to improve their understanding of
   lectures efficiently and effectively. To evaluate whether the proposed
   system can improve learning effectiveness and learners' understanding of
   lectures, we conducted an evaluation experiment and found that the
   proposed system does both. Additionally, a clear difference in the
   number of logs in the digital textbook and the time to answer the quiz
   was confirmed. From these, it is possible to decide whether the learner
   is actively engaged in learning or not.},

Abstract = {Teachers often wish to integrate activities from disparate sources into
   their courses. For example, gamified activities, mediated through
   technology, can promote the type of active learning required to develop
   higher-level engagement by students. However, unless the activities have
   been designed to facilitate it, integrating their analytics into a
   single dashboard can require significant development effort. A general
   solution to such heterogeneous analytics integration can be of great
   value, by presenting a single view of student actions throughout the
   different parts of a course. We describe the problems presented when
   integrating the analytics of three heterogeneous standalone activities,
   in the context of a EU project to improve software engineering teaching.
   The idea is to increase student engagement via gamification, and explore
   the design space of possible solutions for providing integrated
   analytics over the heterogeneous activities. We then describe the design
   of a proof-of-concept implementation, based on the use of both xAPI
   trackers and simple CSV files for information exchange, single sign-on,
   a minimal class management web application, and updates to the analytics
   platform to allow dynamic changes in the multi-level analysis. The
   resulting approach can be readily applied to similar heterogeneous
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {Research in the field of collaboration shows that students do not
   spontaneously collaborate with each other. A system that can measure
   collaboration in real time could be useful by, for example, helping the
   teacher locate a group requiring guidance. To address this challenge, my
   research focuses on building and comparing collaboration detectors for
   different types of classroom problem solving activities, such as card
   sorting and hand writing. I am also studying transfer: how collaboration
   detectors for one task can be used with a new task. Finally, we attempt
   to build a teachers dashboard that can describe reasoning behind the
   triggered alerts thereby helping the teachers with insights to aid the
   collaborative activity. Data for building such detectors were collected
   in the form of verbal interaction and user action logs from students'
   tablets. Three qualitative levels of interactivity was distinguished:
   Collaboration, Cooperation and Asymmetric Contribution. Machine learning
   was used to induce a classifier that can assign a code for every episode
   based on the set of features. Our preliminary results indicate that
   machine learned classifiers were reliable.},

Abstract = {Extensive Reading (ER) activity is useful in language learning where
   learners pick any reading materials in target language by themselves and
   continue reading. In this study, we aim to understand students'
   self-regulation behaviors and strategies in ER so that facilitators can
   give learning strategy-based instruction. For this purpose, we first
   explored a potential structure of a learners' model that can highlight
   their learning strategies and extracted from multi-system interaction
   logs recorded in Experience API (xAPI) format. To demonstrate, we
   collected data from 120 students across 3 months when they did ER
   activities. We analyzed and extracted the self-regulation strategies of
   the learners and found 2 groups by applying K-means cluster analysis.
   The results inform dashboard design and instructional support based on
   the visualized attributes of the cluster members. This study contributes
   towards using interoperability standards to record learner's online
   reading behaviors and demonstrate how teaching and learning activities
   can be supported by xAPI when such experiences are distributed across
   various learning tools.},

Abstract = {Studying in social isolation is a reality for many students that was
   further reinforced after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research
   shows that isolation can lead to decreased learning efficiency and is
   intensified by the increased asynchronous online teaching during the
   pandemic. This change is not only challenging for students, but also for
   teachers, as students do not have a direct communication and feedback
   channel when learning content is presented in form of prerecorded videos
   in a learning management system. In this paper, we present VGather2Learn
   Analytics, which is an extension to the already existing collaborative
   learning system VGather2Learn, which makes it possible for teachers to
   analyse the learning behavior of students in asynchronous
   video-teaching. The information presented in a dashboard will allow
   teachers to better understand how students interact while watching
   learning videos collaboratively and can improve online-teaching.},

Abstract = {Previous studies have investigated the provision of students' relevant
   data, usually available in intuitive dashboards, to assist teachers in
   pedagogical decision-making in learning systems. Researchers are also
   interested in investigating how students' interaction data with
   gamification elements improve teachers' understanding of students'
   status and helps students with adequate pedagogical recommendations.
   However, there is a lack of understanding of how teachers perceive data
   visualizations provided through dashboards recently explored in gamified
   educational systems. In this paper, the authors investigate teachers'
   perceptions about three different dashboards with visualizations about
   1) students' interaction with learning resources, 2) students'
   interaction with gamification elements, and 3) students' interaction
   with learning resources and gamification elements. As such, the
   researchers conducted a mixed-method study with 47 teachers to evaluate
   their perceived understanding, perceived usefulness, perceived
   behavioral change, and perceived decision-making support regarding the
   three dashboards. The results suggest teachers perceived that the
   dashboard with visualizations concerning students' interaction with
   learning resources and gamification elements provide better support to
   them in the decision-making process. Teachers also perceived the third
   dashboard has a more significant potential to impact behavioral changes
   than the other two dashboards.},

Abstract = {In the past years, Blended Learning (BL) has gained traction as a
   methodology in Higher Education Institutions. Despite the positive
   effects of BL, several studies have shown that students require high
   levels of self-regulation to succeed in these types of practices. Still,
   there is little understanding of how students organize their learning in
   BL authentic contexts. To fill this gap, this paper presents an
   exploratory study to analyze the learning tactics and strategies of 119
   students in a BL course using the Moodle Learning Management System.
   Specifically, we examined the effects on students' learning behavior
   before and after an intervention with a dashboard-based plug-in designed
   to support self-regulated learning (SRL). Using a data-driven approach
   based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM), we identified the tactics and
   strategies employed by the students along the course. The results show
   that students' tactics and strategies changed significantly depending on
   the course design and the context in which learning occurs (in or beyond
   the class). Also, we found evidence indicating that the main factor that
   correlates to the students' learning strategies is their previous
   knowledge and the students' SRL ability profile.},

Abstract = {BackgroundOnline video-based learning is more common in higher
   education. Investigating students' viewing behaviors while watching
   online video lectures is essential for instructors to understand their
   learning status so that the course content, structure, and media
   selection can be improved continuously. The current study identified the
   engagement level of the learners based on their online video-watching
   behaviors, and tested the correlation between the engagement level and
   learning outcome. MethodsThe action logs of watching online video
   lectures in 2020 Spring Pharmacology of the 4th-year medical students of
   the 6-year course and their feedbacks by questionnaires after each exam
   during the semester were provided anonymously. The data were analyzed
   and visualized for an efficient way to comprehend and interpret. To
   define the student's engagement level in his or her video-based learning
   journey, three viewing criteria, ``Completion,{''} ``Pausing,{''} and
   ``Repeated watching{''} were identified. We evaluated the association
   between the engagement level and the students' learning outcomes,
   including their learning satisfaction, knowledge acquisition progresses
   based on assessment results, and the grades measured by the instructors.
   ResultsThe graphs and the charts demonstrate whether the students
   allocated enough time to finish the video lectures (completion), paused
   for a while, then resumed the video (pausing), or replayed the specific
   sections of video content (repeated watching). The engagement level with
   video lectures, evaluated by pre-defined thresholds for
   ``Completion,{''} ``Pausing,{''} and ``Repeated watching{''} had a
   positive correlation with the learning outcomes. ConclusionsWe suggested
   that an engagement dashboard containing real-time visualized information
   on students' online video-watching behaviors can be developed to help
   instructors to monitor students' learning progress and improve teaching
   in a timely fashion. It can also help each student to re-feel the
   stimulation of peers, prompt self-monitoring, improve their learning
   attitudes and disciplines for better learning outcomes. This innovative
   way of assessing student's engagement during online video-based learning
   can also be used for quality assurance purposes.},

Abstract = {In today's successful Learning Management System (LMS), gathering
   thousands of students, emergent collective dynamics drive innovative
   learning experiences where learners help each other in online forums.
   The benefits of those behaviors were theorized in Vygotsky's
   socio-constructivism theory where he insists that the knowledge
   development of not so formal peer exchanges is beneficial to all
   participants. Observing and understanding how those dynamics occur could
   improve course design and help tutors intervene to sustain collective
   learning. But, although the scientific community acknowledges the
   importance of theses dynamics, few works have yet been able to grasp and
   display them in a format tailored to the Massive Open Online Courses
   (MOOCs)' instructors. Indeed, only recently have researches been able to
   articulate the required continuous Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
   Social Network Analysis (SNA). In this research, we propose an
   innovative model to compute a collective activity indicator to answer
   the problem of detecting and visualizing the collective dynamics from
   the MOOCs's forums interactions. We also present datasets collected from
   several LMSs and used to illustrate the portability, scalability,
   interactivity of our first visualizations. Our approach should help
   develop indicators and Learning Dashboard (LDB) of collective actions
   for MOOCs.},

Abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) are commonly designed to enhance
   student learning. However, they are not typically designed to meet the
   needs of teachers who use them in their classrooms. ITSs generate a
   wealth of analytics about student learning and behavior, opening a rich
   design space for real-time teacher support tools such as dashboards.
   Whereas real-time dashboards for teachers have become popular with many
   learning technologies, we are not aware of projects that have designed
   dashboards for ITSs based on a broad investigation of teachers' needs.
   We conducted design interviews with ten middle school math teachers to
   explore their needs for on-the-spot support during blended class
   sessions, as a first step in a user-centered design process of a
   real-time dashboard. Based on multi-methods analyses of this interview
   data, we identify several opportunities for ITSs to better support
   teachers' needs, noting that the analytics commonly generated by
   existing teacher support tools do not strongly align with the analytics
   teachers expect to be most useful. We highlight key tensions and
   tradeoffs in the design of such realtime supports for teachers, as
   revealed by ``Speed Dating{''} possible futures with teachers. This
   paper has implications for our ongoing co-design of a real-time
   dashboard for ITSs, as well as broader implications for the design of
   ITSs that can effectively collaborate with teachers in classroom
   settings.},

Abstract = {Collaboration is an important 21st century skill; it can take place in a
   remote or co-located setting. Co-located collaboration (CC) is a very
   complex process which involves subtle human interactions that can be
   described with multimodal indicators (MI) like gaze, speech and social
   skills. In this paper, we first give an overview of related work that
   has identified indicators during CC. Then, we look into the
   stateof-the-art studies on feedback during CC which also make use of MI.
   Finally, we describe a Wizard of Oz (WOz) study where we design a
   privacy-preserving research prototype with the aim to facilitate
   real-time collaboration in-the-wild during three co-located group PhD
   meetings (of 3-7 members). Here, human observers stationed in another
   room act as a substitute for sensors to track different speech-based
   cues (like speaking time and turn taking); this drives a real-time
   visualization dashboard on a public shared display. With this research
   prototype, we want to pave way for design-based research to track other
   multimodal indicators of CC by extending this prototype design using
   both humans and sensors.},

Abstract = {The research presents precision education that aims to regulate
   students' behaviors through the learning analytics dashboard (LAD) in
   the AI-supported smart learning environment (SLE). The LAD basically
   tracks and visualizes traces of learning actions to make students aware
   of their learning behaviors and reflect these against the agreed goals.
   This research aims to realize the digital transformation of the learning
   space, thereby improving students' learning outcomes with the assistance
   of the learning dashboard. To examine whether there was a close
   relationship between the frequency of using the whole platform and
   academic results, the data was collected from 50 first-year university
   students who registered with the innovative thinking course. Based on
   the data, we constructed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)
   questionnaire and interview guide to realize the students' acceptance
   and feedback towards the SLE. Students were clustered into high-mark and
   low-mark groups based on their final results. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test
   is used to identify a significant difference between the two groups
   using the precision education platform. Subsequently, the partial least
   squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) is further utilized to
   analyze the relationship between system quality, perceived ease of use,
   and perceived usefulness on behavioral intention and learning transfer.},

   not provide information about the student's behavior. There are existing
   studies dealing with Process Mining (PM) in education, specifically in
   computer science courses and using Git. Through an empirical exploratory

   contextualized commits using PM. We analyzed data from 5 teaching units
   covering different higher education levels using the bupaR library.
   Firstly, we discovered promising indicators to predict students'

   possibilities for future research on PM and contextualized commits.
   Finally, we have established a set of recommendations to help analyze

Abstract = {Jupyter is a web-based, interactive computing environment that supports
   many commonly-used programming languages. It has been widely adopted in
   the CS education community and is now rapidly expanding to other STEM
   disciplines due to the growing integration of programming in STEM
   education. However, unlike other educational platforms, there is
   currently no integrated way to capture, analyze, and visualize student
   interaction data in Jupyter notebooks. This means that teachers have
   limited to no visibility into student activity, preventing them from
   drawing insights from these data and providing timely interventions on
   the fly. In this paper, we present Jupyter Analytics, an end-to-end
   solution for teachers to collect, analyze, and visualize both
   synchronous and asynchronous learning activities in Jupyter. The Jupyter
   Analytics system consists of two JupyterLab extensions connected via a
   cloud-based backend. On the student side, we introduce the Jupyter
   Analytics Telemetry extension to anonymously capture students'
   interaction activity with more structure and higher granularity than log
   data. On the teacher side, we introduce the Jupyter Analytics Dashboard
   extension, which visualizes real-time student data directly in the
   notebook interface. The Jupyter Analytics system was developed through
   an iterative co-design process with university instructors and teaching
   assistants, and has been implemented and tested in several university
   STEM courses. We report two use cases where Jupyter Analytics impacted
   teaching and learning in the context of exercise sessions, and discuss
   the potential value of our tools for CS education.},

Title = {How Teacher Characteristics Relate to How Teachers Use Dashboards:
   Results from Two Case Studies in K-12},

Abstract = {Teacher dashboards are a specific form of analytics in which visual
   displays provide teachers with information about their students; for
   example, concerning student progress and performance on tasks during
   lessons or lectures. In the present paper, we focus on the role of
   teacher dashboards in the context of teacher decision-making in K-12
   education. There is large variation in teacher dashboard use in the
   classroom, which could be explained by teacher characteristics.
   Therefore, we investigate the role of teacher characteristics - such as
   experience, age, gender, and self-efficacy - in how teachers use
   dashboards. More specifically, we present two case studies to understand
   how diversity in teacher dashboard use is related to teacher
   characteristics. Surprisingly, in both case studies, teacher
   characteristics were not associated with dashboard use. Based on our
   findings, we propose an initial framework to understand what contributes
   to diversity of dashboard use. This framework might support future
   research to attribute diversity in dashboard use. This paper should be
   seen as a first step in examining the role of teacher characteristics in
   dashboard use in K-12 education.},

Abstract = {The massive and open nature of MOOCs contribute to attracting a great
   diversity of learners. However, the learners who enroll in these types
   of courses have trouble achieving their course objectives. One reason
   for this is that they do not adequately self-regulate their learning. In
   this context, there are few tools to support these strategies in online
   learning environment. Also, the lack of metrics to evaluate the impact
   of the proposed tools makes it difficult to identify the key features of
   this type of tools. In this paper, we present the process for designing
   NoteMyProgress, a web application that complements a MOOC platform and
   supports self-regulated learning strategies. For designing
   NoteMyProgress we followed the Design Based Research methodology. For
   the evaluation of the tool, we conducted two case studies using a beta
   version of NoteMyProgress over three MOOCs offered in Coursera. The
   findings of these two case studies are presented as a set of lessons
   learned that inform about: (1) a list of requirements to inform the
   design of a second version of the tool; (2) a list of requirements that
   could serve as a reference for other developers to design new tools that
   support self-regulated learning in MOOCs.},

Abstract = {Open Educational Resources (OER) are available resources for teaching,
   learning, and research distributed under an open license. They are
   considered essential building blocks in educational systems, as they can
   be freely used, modified, and shared. However, there are still many
   challenges that hinder the proper utilization of OER at schools as well
   as in higher education institutions. One of these challenges is the lack
   of technical tools that support producing OER or converting existing
   educational materials to OER. In order to overcome this problem, the OER
   Conversion Tool convOERter has been developed at the Learning
   Technologies Research Group of RWTH Aachen University. The main
   functionality of the tool is to support converting existing educational
   materials to OER by extracting images from the input files and replacing
   them with OER-compliant images retrieved from OER image portals. Since
   it is crucial to understand the tool's usage and to trace the
   interaction between the tool and the end users, an evaluation system,
   consisting of a logging module, analytics engines, and a dashboard has
   been developed and integrated. In this paper, we will introduce the
   system's conceptual design and illustrate its main modules. We will also
   highlight how and to which extent convOERter is being used by tracing
   and analyzing the interaction logs of the integrated system.
   Additionally, we will summarize the results of a usability study that
   was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the evaluation system.},

Abstract = {MOOC platforms typically gather data on learner activity and
   demographics on multiple datasets for their analysis. Cross-analysis of
   learner activity pattern against demographic features such as age,
   profession, and nationality can provide some insights on the
   relationship between the diversity of learners and their behaviour.
   These analyses are often performed on individual courses, and the
   results do not often translate well across the course offering.
   Moreover, despite the massive numbers of learners, demographic data is
   often difficult to obtain, with a small proportion of the learning
   community being represented. The analysis of aggregate data can help to
   enhance the significance generalisability of the results when combining
   activity and demographic data. However, aggregating data entails
   analytical challenges that can sometimes lead to misleading results. In
   this paper we analyse aggregate data from a set of MOOCs in the
   FutureLearn platform which have been produced by a British university.
   Some of the results suggest that certain demographic features such as
   education level do not have a significant influence in engagement
   measures such as completion of courses. However, other demographic
   features such as age do have an influence. The paper then considers some
   of the caveats of aggregating data from different courses, and proposes
   solutions to overcome them.},

Abstract = {After the COVID-19 pandemic, universities moved towards online and
   Blended Learning (BL) modes to offer greater curricular flexibility.
   Yet, recent research shows that students have difficulties regulating
   their learning strategies to adapt to the different learning modes that
   BL entails, which mixes face-to-face with online activities taking place
   in different learning contexts and environments. Prior work on
   Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) has explored the use of dashboard-based
   scaffolds for supporting students' learning strategies. However, most
   existing solutions are designed for supporting students in online
   settings (i.e., MOOCs), disregarding the teachers' role in BL settings
   and the support they need to monitor and promote students' SRL. This
   paper presents the design process followed for transforming a tool
   designed for supporting students' SRL in MOOCs into a Moodle plugin for
   BL. Following a design-based research methodological approach, we
   describe all the phases conducted for identifying the most appropriate
   indicators and visualizations for supporting SRL in BL practices,
   implementing and evaluating a first prototype. Results of a local

Abstract = {Peer Assessment (PA) is a promising evaluation strategy in the
   educational context, not only due to its effectiveness to reduce
   instructor's evaluation loading, but mainly due to its benefit towards
   student development e.g., teamwork, in-depth thinking. In this
   exploratory study we sought to explore how do educational data, as
   generated by an online platform (i.e., Peergrade) and displayed in
   teacher's and students' Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD), can
   potentially inform us of the PA process and the peer interactions, as
   they take place. Participants in the study were 21 undergraduate
   teacher-students who attended a science course (electrical circuits
   topic) following the inquiry-based approach. Students were asked to
   reciprocally and individually assess the responses of a peer in a given
   task. The findings of this study have implications towards the
   establishment of new theoretical frameworks and developments for
   bridging educational theory, design process and data science, in the
   field of assessment.},

Abstract = {The increasing use of the Learning Management Systems (LMSs) is making
   available an ever-growing, volume of data from interactions between
   teachers and students. This study aimed to develop a model capable of
   predicting students' academic performance based on indicators of their
   self-regulated behavior in LMSs. To accomplish this goal, the authors
   analyzed behavioral data from an LMS platform used in a public
   University for distance learning courses, collected during a period of
   seven years. With this data, they developed, evaluated, and compared
   predictive models using four algorithms: Decision Tree (CART), Logistic
   Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes. The Logistic Regression model yielded
   the best results in predicting students' academic performance, being
   able to do so with an accuracy rate of 0.893 and an area under the ROC
   curve of 0.9574. Finally, they conceived and implemented a
   dashboard-like interface intended to present the predictions in a
   user-friendly way to tutors and teachers, so they could use it as a tool
   to help monitor their students' learning process.},

Abstract = {Detection and visualizations of affective states of students in computer
   based learning environments have been proposed to support student
   awareness and improve learning. However, the evaluation of such
   visualizations with students in real life settings is an open issue.
   This research reports on our experiences from the use of four different
   types of dashboard visualizations in two user studies (n= 115). Students
   who participated in the studies were bachelor and master level students
   from two different study programs at two universities. The results
   indicate that usability, measured by interpretability, perceived
   usefulness and insight, is overall acceptable. However, the findings
   also suggest that interpretability of some visualizations, in terms of
   the capability to support emotion awareness, still needs to be improved.
   The level of students awareness about their emotions during learning
   activities based on the visualization interpretation varied depending on
   previous knowledge on visualization techniques. Furthermore, simpler
   visualizations resulted in better outcomes than more complex techniques.},

Abstract = {Data are crucial to improve decision-making and obtain greater benefits
   in any type of activity. However, the large amount of information
   generated by new technologies has made data analysis and knowledge
   generation a complex task. Numerous tools have emerged to facilitate
   this generation of knowledge, such as dashboards. Although dashboards
   are useful tools, their effectiveness can be affected by poor design or
   by not taking into account the context in which they are placed.
   Therefore, it is necessary to design and create custom dashboards
   according to the audience and data domain. This paper presents an
   application of the software product line paradigm and the integration of
   this approach into a web service to allow users to request source code
   for customized information dashboards. The main goal is to introduce the
   idea of creating a holistic ecosystem of different services to craft and
   integrate information visualizations in a variety of contexts. One of
   the contexts that can be especially favored by this approach is the
   educational context, where learning analytics, data analysis of student
   performance, and didactic tools are becoming very relevant. Three
   different use cases of this approach are presented to illustrate the
   benefits of the developed generative service.},

Abstract = {Creating a set of quizzes for the students' test is almost an
   irreplaceable task to teachers. In practice, a teacher could use a
   learning analytics dashboard while creating a test to control the quiz
   difficulty and the amount of time it takes to solve. This paper draws
   inspiration from this practical example, and we propose an automated
   test set quiz maker by optimizing the time and learning parameters that
   have been estimated from the analysis of learning logs. First, we
   estimate the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) model parameters: in
   particular the guess and slip probability from the quiz answer log
   history. The system automatically generates a test set of quizzes if the
   user inputs the desired amount of time it should take to solve the test
   by optimizing the selection of quizzes based on BKT parameters and
   estimated solving time. This function is expected to reduce the burden
   of preparing examination questions for teachers, and it can be used as a
   trial test before the exam for students.},

Abstract = {The adequate emotional state of students has proved to be essential for
   favoring learning. This paper explores the possibility of obtaining
   students' feedback about the emotions they feel in class in order to
   discover potential emotion patterns that might indicate learning fails.
   This paper presents a visual dashboard that allows students to track
   their emotions and follow up on their evolution during the course. We
   have compiled the principal classroom related emotions and developed a
   two-phase inquiry process to: verify the possibility to measure
   students' emotions in classroom; discover how emotions can be displayed
   to promote self-reflection; and confirm the impact of emotions on
   learning performance. Our results suggest that students' emotions in
   class are related to evaluation marks. This shows that early information
   about students' emotions can be useful for teachers and students to
   improve classroom results and learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Serious Games (SG) are increasingly used by educators to assist the
   teaching and learning process and offer many advantages over traditional
   education. They are highly engaging, motivating and they have the
   potential to adapt to each student quickly becoming an ideal
   supplementary tool for education. However, if the majority of teachers
   agree that using SGs increases the motivation, learning and retention of
   their students, very few of them are ready to trust their assessment to
   verify that the learning goals have been met. They would rather adopt a
   more conventional method such as a paper-based test. We believe two main
   reasons explain this attitude: a lack of ownership over the games used
   and the rigidness of the games, making them unmodifiable by the teacher.
   To overcome these issues, we have developed an assessment engine to be
   used by both SG developers and educators. The engine's design results in
   a separation of a game and its assessment, and the resulting modularity
   allows the teachers to modify the assessment of a game even after
   distribution. This paper focuses on the teacher interface of the
   assessment engine. After reviewing the literature associated with ingame
   assessment and learning analytics, the paper will provide a summary of
   the engine and its functionalities, present the Learning Analytics (LA)
   dashboard. We will then describe the visual language that allows
   teachers to edit a game's assessment system based on the LA reports.
   Thereafter, the authorisation and versioning mechanics of the engine
   will be detailed, showing how the system regulates the access to the
   games and stressing the fact that every teacher will have, after
   modification, a unique game customised to their students' needs.
   Finally, we will provide conclusions and state the remaining work to be
   undertaken.},

Title = {Designing an Intelligent Virtual Educational System to Improve the
   Efficiency of Primary Education in Developing Countries},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Incorporating technology into virtual education encourages educational
   institutions to demand a migration from the current learning management
   system towards an intelligent virtual educational system, seeking
   greater benefit by exploiting the data generated by students in their
   day-to-day activities. Therefore, the design of these intelligent
   systems must be performed from a new perspective, which will take
   advantage of the new analytical functions provided by technologies such
   as artificial intelligence, big data, educational data mining
   techniques, and web analytics. This paper focuses on primary education
   in developing countries, showing the design of an intelligent virtual
   educational system to improve the efficiency of primary education
   through recommendations based on reliable data. The intelligent system
   is formed of four subsystems: data warehousing, analytical data
   processing, monitoring process and recommender system for educational
   agents. To illustrate this, the paper contains two dashboards that
   analyze, respectively, the digital resources usage time and an aggregate
   profile of teachers' digital skills, in order to infer new activities
   that improve efficiency. These intelligent virtual educational systems
   focus the teaching-learning process on new forms of interaction on an
   educational future oriented to personalized teaching for the students,
   and new evaluation and teaching processes for each professor.},

Title = {From concept to classroom: Developing instructor dashboards through
   human centered design},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION OPEN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Dashboards visually provide automated feedback and communicate classroom
   data that instructors cannot otherwise recall. To date, dashboards have
   been designed more from a technical than a pedagogical perspective.
   Although researchers have called for a human-centered approach to
   dashboard design, research documenting design processes has been limited
   in the literature. In the present study, a human-centered approach was
   employed to design an instructor dashboard. The design processes and
   illustrative prototypes are presented, along with the features
   participant instructors perceived to be the most and least helpful. The
   integration of a human-centered approach to guide the processes involved
   in designing actionable instructor dashboards is also discussed. Three
   components of a human centered approach are recommended: (a) designing
   with multiple stakeholders, (b) aligning pedagogy with analytics, and
   (c) training on data use. This research contributes to the field by
   demonstrating how human-centered design can bridge the gap between
   technological potentials and pedagogical features in instructor
   dashboards, ultimately leading to effective integration of such tools in
   higher education classrooms.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) skills are especially important in Massive
   Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where teacher guidance is scarce, and
   learners must engage in their learning process trying to succeed and
   achieve their learning goals. However, developing SRL strategies is
   difficult for learners given the autonomy that is required in this kind
   of courses. In order to support learners on this process, researchers
   have proposed a variety of tools designed to support certain aspects of
   self-regulation in online learning environments. Nevertheless, there is
   a lack of study to understand what the commonalities and differences in
   terms of design are, what the results in terms of the effect on
   learners' self-regulation are and which of them could be applied in
   MOOCs. Those are the questions that should be further explored. In this
   paper we present a systematic literature review where 22 tools designed
   to support SRL in online environments were analyzed. Our findings
   indicate that: (1) most of the studies do not evaluate the effect on
   learners' SRL strategies; (2) the use of interactive visualizations has
   a positive effect on learners' motivation; (3) the use of the social
   comparison component has a positive effect on engagement and time
   management; and (4) there is a lack of models to match learners'
   activity with the tools with SRL strategies. Finally, we present the
   lessons learned for guiding the community in the implementation of tools
   to support SRL strategies in MOOCs.},

Abstract = {Background: A game was developed using virtual reality (VR) technologies
   to teach graph theory in a visual, hands-on way. An iterative model was
   devised to design, build and pilot the game. With virtual hands,
   learners were able to manipulate graphs in an immersive environment. The
   game guided the learner through the game's mechanics and fundamental
   concepts of graph theory before presenting real-world examples of graph
   theory and progressively more difficult challenges to solve. Learners
   were also presented with a dashboard containing visualizations, such as
   progression of learning (mapped to Biggs's SOLO taxonomy), badges and a
   leaderboard. A study was carried out with the purpose of: measuring the
   effectiveness of the game in teaching graph theory; measuring the game's
   success from a universal design for learning standpoint; measuring how
   motivated learners were to play more games like it; discovering
   strategies employed by learners in an immersive VR environment;
   analysing gathered data to gain insights into how learners learned and
   solved challenges.
   Methods: A combination of methods were used in the study of learners
   (N=20) playing the game. Observational notes were taken while watching
   gameplay projected on a large screen. A think aloud protocol was in
   place allowing learners to verbalize their thoughts as they played. Data
   was automatically gathered by the game engine and stored for later
   analysis. A questionnaire was administered to the learners with some
   questions mapped to models of game-based learning evaluation and
   universal design for learning.
   Results: A significant majority of learners reported that the game
   improved their understanding of the fundamentals of graph theory, that
   their interest was stimulated in playing more games like it, and that it
   was a quick way to learn about graph theory. They also found
   visualizations of their learning (including progression) in a dashboard
   to be clear, understandable and useful. The game was successful from a
   universal design perspective. Some learners stated aloud that they were
   visual or hands-on learners and that the game suited their way of
   learning. Further data analysis and visualization revealed that it was
   possible to identify where learners were engaged with real-world
   examples and where learners resorted to trial and error tactics in the
   challenges. Observations also revealed that learners, in the freedom of
   an immersive VR environment, engaged in a range of different strategies
   while solving challenges.
   Conclusions: One of the principles of the Universal Design for Learning
   framework is offering choice. When a VR game is offered as a choice
   alongside more traditional modes of teaching, learners will respond
   positively, though careful design is required - the design of the game
   involved a careful mapping of learning to a taxonomy and the game
   gathered data that allowed for visualization of learner progression.
   Signposting of learning objectives and then showing learner progression
   toward those objectives, along with immediate formative feedback, are an
   effective way of engaging students and improving learning outcomes.
   Learner autonomy can be aided by an immersive VR environment, as
   evidenced by the different strategies being employed by different
   learners to solve challenges in the game.},

Abstract = {The creation of MOOCs is an intense process, with many challenges not
   found in the development of traditional university courses. At The
   University of Queensland, an experienced team of learning designers,
   videographers, an animator, software developers and a project manager in
   collaboration with academics who provide knowledge domain specialisation
   have been responsible for the production of nine diverse MOOCs over the
   past two years. These MOOCs have been produced for delivery on the edX
   platform with a total enrolment of 272,000 to date. This paper discusses
   the framework used for the development and delivery of a UQx MOOC, and
   how this is then mapped onto the edX platform.
   Videos play an integral part of the process, but can be a bottleneck
   when large numbers of videos need to be produced by a production team
   consisting of three people. To address this, a self-service video studio
   was developed and additional recording and editing spaces created for
   presenters to speed the production process. Details of the studio design
   are presented along with the challenges experienced by the media team.
   Additionally, the current version of the edX platform has a limited but
   growing set of interactive tools used for assessment and interaction.
   These tools were enhanced by judicious modifications of the user
   interface through the creation of specialised scripts by the software
   development team, thus bypassing the need to modify the edX platform
   code. A dashboard and analytics platform has been developed by the
   software team to report on the gross statistics of each of the courses,
   extracting the relevant data from the gigabytes of analytic data
   delivered from edX each week. This data is then used to drive decisions
   made by the UQx team and the academics responsible for course content.
   Select tools and reports are shared within this paper.
   Examples and reflections on each step in the course development process
   are presented as well as the different approaches taken by course teams
   in the presentation of the content and the assessment. Additional data
   about the student experience in these courses and how that experience is
   being used to transform on-campus learning through the development of
   Small Private Online Courses (SPOCs) for flipped and blended classroom
   use and other online components is addressed.},

Abstract = {Advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have
   increased the growth of Massive open online courses (MOOCs) applied in
   distance learning environments. Various tools have been utilized to
   deliver interactive content including pictures, figures, and videos that
   can motivate the learners to build new cognitive skills. High ranking
   universities have adopted MOOCs as an efficient dashboard platform where
   learners from around the world can participate in such courses. The
   students learning progress is evaluated by using set computer-marked
   assessments. In particular, the computer gives immediate feedback to the
   student once he or she completes the online assessments.
   The researchers claim that student success rate in an online course can
   be related to their performance at the previous session in addition to
   the level of engagement. Insufficient attention has been paid by
   literature to evaluate whether student performance and engagement in the
   prior assessments could affect student achievement in the next
   assessments.
   In this paper, two predictive models have been designed namely students'
   assessments grades and final students' performance. The models can be
   used to detect the factors that influence students' learning achievement
   in MOOCs. The result shows that both models gain feasible and accurate
   results. The lowest RSME gain by RF acquire a value of 8.131 for
   students assessments grades model while GBM yields the highest accuracy
   in final students' performance, an average value of 0.086 was achieved.},

Abstract = {When teaching at scale in the physical classroom or online classroom of
   a MOOC, the scarce resource of personal instructor communication becomes
   a differentiating factor between the quality of learning experience
   available in smaller classrooms. In this paper, through real-time
   predictive modeling of engagement analytics, we augment a MOOC platform
   with personalized communication affordances, allowing the instructional
   staff to direct communication to learners based on individual
   predictions of three engagement analytics. The three model analytics are
   the current probability of earning a certificate, of submitting enough
   materials to pass the class, and of leaving the class and not returning.
   We engineer an interactive analytics interface in edX which is populated
   with real-time predictive analytics from a backend API service. The
   instructor can target messages to, for example, all learners who are
   predicted to complete all materials but not pass the class. Our approach
   utilizes the state-of-the-art in recurrent neural network
   classification, evaluated on a MOOC dataset of 20 courses and deployed
   in one. We provide evaluation of these courses, comparing a manual
   feature engineering approach to an automatic feature learning approach
   using neural networks. Our provided code for the front-end and back-end
   allows any instructional team to add this personalized communication
   dashboard to their edX course granted they have access to the historical
   clickstream data from a previous offering of the course, their course's
   daily provided log data, and an external machine to run the model
   service API.},

Abstract = {Open-ended e-learning environments allow for explorative behaviour in
   challenging scenarios and hence, foster problem-solving competences. The
   web-based office simulation LUCA (funded by the German Federal Ministry
   of Education and Research) addresses the domain-specific competences of
   students in commercial vocational education and training (VET). The
   office simulation provides authentic office tools such as a spreadsheet
   application and an ERP software to solve complex work scenarios. These
   scenarios are implemented via the ``LUCA Editor{''} and can contain
   automated assistance based on evidence rules of certain behaviours
   ({''}scaffolding{''}). The real-time analysis of the resulting log files
   enables the analysis of individual problem-solving behaviour
   ({''}Problem Solving Analytics{''}, PSA). Teachers and trainers can
   monitor their students' problem-solving efforts in the ``LUCA
   Dashboard{''}, where they can also provide individual assistance via a
   chat tool. In our contribution, the scientific foundations of PSA will
   be outlined, followed by a demonstration of the latest prototype of LUCA
   and visitors' interaction with the software. LUCA's alpha version will
   be released in September of this year and will be available for
   practitioners in vocational schools and companies.},

Abstract = {Within the education sector, there is growing recognition of the
   importance of diverse data sets in aiding strategic decisions and
   supporting personalized learning. To date, this call for increased and
   more nuanced data has been translated into institutional use of data
   dashboards or learning analytics dashboards. While these dashboards have
   been extensively developed and adopted in higher education, there is
   limited research investigating the use of dashboards in K-12 education.
   To address this gap, this study presents a systematic literature review
   examining dashboards as a decision-making system in K-12 settings. Our
   analysis indicates significant underuse of data in these dashboards,
   with a concerning scarcity of implementations and evaluations in
   real-world classroom environments. To counteract these shortcomings, we
   propose a set of recommendations designed to enhance dashboard
   development by promoting the use of Learner Profiles (LPs). These
   guidelines aim to support educational outcomes and student success by
   informing the design and deployment of fine-grained dashboards
   alignedwith the specific needs of K-12 education. By highlighting the
   current gaps and offering forward-looking recommendations, our study
   clarifies the present landscape and serves as a foundation for future
   research, with significant implications for educators, policymakers, and
   scholars interested in using LPs to improve student learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Source code plagiarism is a significant issue in educational practice,
   and educators need user-friendly tools to cope with such academic
   dishonesty. This article introduces the latest version of Dolos, a
   state-of-theart ecosystem of tools for detecting and preventing
   plagiarism in educational source code. In this new version, the primary
   focus has been on enhancing the user experience. Educators can now run
   the entire plagiarism detection pipeline from a new web app in their
   browser, eliminating the need for any installation or configuration.
   Completely redesigned analytics dashboards provide an instant assessment
   of whether a collection of source files contains suspected cases of
   plagiarism and how widespread plagiarism is within the collection. The
   dashboards support hierarchically structured navigation to facilitate
   zooming in and out of suspect cases. Clusters are an essential new
   component of the dashboard design, reflecting the observation that
   plagiarism can occur among larger groups of students. To meet various
   user needs, the Dolos software stack for source code plagiarism
   detection now includes a self-hostable web app, a JSON application
   programming interface (API), a command line interface (CLI), a
   JavaScript library and a preconfigured Docker container. Clear
   documentation and a free-to-use instance of the web app can be found at
   https://dolos.ugent.be. The source code is also available on GitHub.},

Abstract = {Collaborative learning is an important approach in education.
   Researchers are increasingly interested in using physiological data,
   such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA), as an objective tool to measure
   bodily reactions during collaborative activities. However, it remains
   unclear how physiological data can contribute to our understanding,
   monitoring and support of the collaborative learning process. To address
   this gap, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted, focusing
   on the contribution of physiological data to collaborative learning, the
   features of physiological data that correlate with effective outcomes,
   and interventions designed to support collaboration based on
   physiological data. The review identified 13 relevant publications that
   revealed physiological data can indeed be useful for detecting certain
   aspects of collaboration including students' cognitive, behavioral, and
   affective (emotion and motivation) states. Physiological arousal in the
   form of EDA peaks and physiological synchrony (interdependence or
   associated activity between individuals' physiological signals) were the
   most commonly used features. Surprisingly, only one publication
   presented a prototype of a learning analytics dashboard that used
   physiological data to guide student reflections. Furthermore, the review
   highlights the potential for integrating physiological measures with
   other data sources, such as speech, eye gaze, and facial expression, to
   uncover psychophysiological reactions and accompanying social and
   contextual processes related to collaborative learning. Future research
   should consider embedding methods for the physiological detection and
   modeling of learning constructs within explicit, feedback-driven
   interventions for collaborative learning.},

Abstract = {Educational explainable AI (XAI) applications are gaining research focus
   and have distinct needs in the domain of Education. This research
   presents Educational eXplainable AI Tool (EXAIT), a system for math quiz
   recommendations, along with an explanation. EXAIT was implemented in a
   Japanese public high school where students received the top 5 math
   problems based on Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) algorithm in a
   learning analytics dashboard. It aimed to help them complete their
   summer vacation assignments having 240 questions. On click, the students
   were redirected to an eBook platform to submit their accuracy and
   confidence level in each problem. We conducted a study with a
   quasi-experimental design and divided into 3 groups based on compliance
   of use. RecoExp group received and used explanations regarding why an
   item was recommended and how it aims to maximize learners'
   knowledge-gaining path. RecoCon was the control group that received just
   the recommendations and used it and RecoNone group did not use the
   system at all during the time period. We provide a framework to analyze
   learning logs from EXAIT and extract emerging self-directed learning
   patterns. Analyzing 222 students' EXAIT logs, we found learners who had
   checked explanations while selecting recommendations had significantly
   higher performance. Further differential process mining highlighted
   significant active daily engagement transitions of the RecoExp group in
   the self-directed activity.},

Abstract = {The application of educational digital games (EDG) requires multiple
   perspectives for an optimal adaptation. This study shows how relevant
   feedback is presented in simple outcome reports of EDG-based learning
   for teachers and parents in Natural Language (NL). NL as a Machine
   Learning process also can represent quantitative data sets in consumable
   Spanish language statements. The objective is to improve outcomes of EDG
   platforms using a cloud-based dashboard used to evaluate student EDG
   application behavioral efficiency. A novel tool is proposed to provide
   simple language explanations rather than statistical representations of
   feedback to parents and teachers in marginal areas of developing
   economies. With fuzzy logic, the researchers present verbatim
   explanations of student behavior towards educational EDG. Results reveal
   comprehensive, simple, or colloquial Spanish language information for
   parents and teachers to provide improved evaluation keys to enhance
   student learning via EDG related to the school curricula.},

Abstract = {Clickstream data have been used increasingly to present students in
   online courses with analytics about their learning process to support
   self-regulation. Drawing on self-regulated learning theory and
   attribution theory, we hypothesize that providing students with
   analytics on their own effort along with the effort and performance of
   relevant peers will help students attribute their performance to factors
   under their control and thus positively influence their subsequent
   behavior and performance. To test the effect of the analytics and verify
   the proposed mechanism, we conducted an experiment in an online
   undergraduate course in which students were randomly assigned to receive
   theoretically inert questions (control condition), attribution questions
   (active control condition), and the analytics with attribution questions
   (treatment condition). The intervention significantly increased effort
   attribution, reduced ability attribution, and improved subsequent effort
   for a subgroup of students who self-reported low performance, although
   there was no significant impact on their performance.},

Title = {Informative Feedback and Explainable AI-Based Recommendations to Support
   Students' Self-regulation},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning is an essential skill that can help students
   plan, monitor, and reflect on their learning in order to achieve their
   learning goals. However, in situations where there is a lack of
   effective feedback and recommendations, it becomes challenging for
   students to self-regulate their learning. In this paper, we propose an
   explainable AI-based approach to provide automatic and intelligent
   feedback and recommendations that can support the self-regulation of
   students' learning in a data-driven manner, with the aim of improving
   their performance on their courses. Prior studies have predicted
   students' performance and have used these predicted outcomes as
   feedback, without explaining the reasons behind the predictions. Our
   proposed approach is based on an algorithm that explains the root causes
   behind a decline in student performance, and generates data-driven
   recommendations for taking appropriate actions. The proposed approach
   was implemented in the form of a dashboard to support self-regulation by
   students on a university course, and was evaluated to determine its
   effects on the students' academic performance. The results revealed that
   the dashboard significantly enhanced students' learning achievements and
   improved their self-regulated learning skills. Furthermore, it was found
   that the recommendations generated by the proposed approach positively
   affected students' performance and assisted them in self-regulation},

Title = {Gamification bolsters self-regulated learning, learning performance and
   reduces strategy decline in flipped classrooms: A longitudinal
   quasi-experiment},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {230},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Flipped classrooms, which foster active learning, are becoming more
   prevalent in higher education. Yet, many students struggle with
   self-regulated learning (SRL) skills and prefer traditional learning
   methods. The use of SRL relies on both students' motivation and skills
   but it is unclear how these skills evolve over time since many previous
   studies often overlook the temporal effects of interventions. To address
   these challenges, we introduced a gamified self-regulated flipped
   learning (GSRFL) approach. This approach integrates gamification
   elements and self-regulation supports, such as a learning analytics
   dashboard, to motivate and aid students' behaviors across three main SRL
   stages: planning, execution, and self-evaluation. We conducted a
   longitudinal quasi-experimental study with first-year university
   students to examine the impact on their SRL behaviors. The longitudinal
   study offers a considerable methodological advantage by providing
   detailed information about an intervention's impact over time. The
   experimental group (N = 76) utilized the GSRFL approach, while the
   control group (N = 75) employed the same self- regulated flipped
   learning approach but without gamification. Results showed that
   gamification significantly improved students' English learning
   achievement and overall SRL behaviors. Longitudinal observations
   revealed a positive main intervention effect on metacognitive monitoring
   behaviors, despite a natural decline in SRL behaviors over time.
   Gamification effectively moderated the decline of underutilized SRL
   strategies like goal setting and time management. These results
   underscore gamification's potential to enhance academic performance and
   promote SRL skills.},

Title = {Exploring the impact of chat-based collaborative activities and

   participation in collaborative activities, retention, and learning in
   MOOCs},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-SUPPORTED COLLABORATIVE LEARNING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 AUG 23},
Abstract = {Despite their potential to deliver a high-quality learning experience,
   massive open online courses (MOOCs) pose several issues, such as high
   dropout rates, difficulties in collaboration between students, low
   teaching involvement, and limited teacher-student interaction. Most of
   these issues can be attributed to the large number, diversity, and
   variation in self-regulated learning (SRL) skills of participants in
   MOOCs. Many instructional designers try to overcome these issues by
   incorporating collaborative activities. Others try to scaffold students'
   SRL levels by making SRL-focused interventions. However, limited
   research combines the study of SRL-focused interventions with students'
   engagement in collaborative activities, course retention, and learning
   outcomes of MOOC environments. We deployed a programming-oriented MOOC
   in which we incorporated chat-based collaborative activities, supported
   by a learning analytics dashboard. Students were asked to complete
   SRL-focused questionnaires at the beginning and the end of the course.
   Based on their score, we calculated an average score that forms their
   SRL level, creating three groups: (a) control, (b) general intervention,
   and (c) personalized intervention in which we provided personalized
   interventions. We compared the students' learning outcomes,
   participation in collaborative activities, and retention in the MOOC.
   These comparisons provided evidence regarding the positive impact of
   different intervention modes on students' engagement in collaborative
   activities and their learning outcomes, with respect to their various
   SRL profiles. Students allocated to the general and personalized
   intervention groups displayed increased participation in the
   collaborative activities and learning outcomes, as compared to students
   assigned to the control group. We also documented that the SRL
   interventions positively affected students' course retention.},

Title = {Use of Commercially Produced Medical Education Videos in a
   Cardiovascular Curriculum: Multiple Cohort Study},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Short instructional videos can make learning more efficient
   through the application of multimedia principles, and video animations
   can illustrate the complex concepts and dynamic processes that are
   common in health sciences education. Commercially produced videos are
   commonly used by medical students but are rarely integrated into
   curricula.
   Objective: Our goal was to examine student engagement with medical
   education videos incorporated into a preclinical Cardiovascular Systems
   course.
   Methods: Students who took the first-year 8-week Cardiovascular Systems
   course in 2019 and 2020 were included in the study. Videos from Osmosis
   were recommended to be watched before live sessions throughout the
   course. Video use was monitored through dashboards, and course credit
   was given for watching videos. All students were emailed electronic
   surveys after the final exam asking about the course's blended learning
   experience and use of videos. Osmosis usage data for number of video
   views, multiple choice questions, and flashcards were extracted from
   Osmosis dashboards.
   Results: Overall, 232/359 (64.6\%) students completed surveys, with
   rates by class of 81/154 (52.6\%) for MD Class of 2022, 39/50 (78\%) for
   MD/MPH Class of 2022, and 112/155 (72.3\%) for MD Class of 2023. Osmosis
   dashboard data were available for all 359 students. All students
   received the full credit offered for Osmosis engagement, and learning
   analytics demonstrated regular usage of videos and other digital
   platform features. Survey responses indicated that most students found
   Osmosis videos to be helpful for learning (204/232, 87.9\%; P=.001) and
   preferred Osmosis videos to the traditional lecture format (134/232,
   57.8\%; P<.001).
   Conclusions: Commercial medical education videos may enhance curriculum
   with low faculty effort and improve students' learning experiences.
   Findings from our experience at one medical school can guide the
   effective use of supplemental digital resources for learning, and
   related evaluation and research.},

   support the optimum use of crop inputs for plant growth, faster
   production cycles, multiple growing seasons per annum and increased
   yield, while offering greater control of pests, disease and adverse
   weather. Globally, there has been a rapid increase in the adoption of
   PCS. However, there remains a concerning knowledge gap in the
   availability of accurate and up-to-date spatial information that defines
   the extent (location and area) of PCS. This data is fundamental for
   providing metrics that inform decision making around forward selling,
   labour, processing and infrastructure requirements, traceability,
   biosecurity and natural disaster preparedness and response. This project
   addresses this need, by developing a national map of PCS for Australia
   using remotely sensed imagery and deep learning analytics, ancillary
   data, field validation and industry engagement. The resulting map
   presents the location and extent of all commercial glasshouses,
   polyhouses, polytunnels, shadehouses and permanent nets with an area of
   >0.2 ha. The outcomes of the project revealed deep learning techniques
   can accurately map PCS with models achieving F-Scores > 0.9 and
   accelerate the mapping where suitable imagery is available.
   Location-based tools supported by web mapping applications were critical
   for the validation of PCS locations and for building industry awareness
   and engagement. The final national PCS map is publicly available through
   an online dashboard which summarises the area of PCS structures at a
   range of scales including state/territory, local government area and
   individual structure. The outcomes of this project have set a global
   standard on how this level of mapping can be achieved through a
   collaborative, multifaceted approach.},

Title = {Customized Rule-Based Model to Identify At-Risk Students and Propose
   Rational Remedial Actions},
Journal = {BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Detecting at-risk students provides advanced benefits for improving
   student retention rates, effective enrollment management, alumni
   engagement, targeted marketing improvement, and institutional
   effectiveness advancement. One of the success factors of educational
   institutes is based on accurate and timely identification and
   prioritization of the students requiring assistance. The main objective
   of this paper is to detect at-risk students as early as possible in
   order to take appropriate correction measures taking into consideration
   the most important and influential attributes in students' data. This
   paper emphasizes the use of a customized rule-based system (RBS) to
   identify and visualize at-risk students in early stages throughout the
   course delivery using the Risk Flag (RF). Moreover, it can serve as a
   warning tool for instructors to identify those students that may
   struggle to grasp learning outcomes. The module allows the instructor to
   have a dashboard that graphically depicts the students' performance in
   different coursework components. The at-risk student will be
   distinguished (flagged), and remedial actions will be communicated to
   the student, instructor, and stakeholders. The system suggests remedial
   actions based on the severity of the case and the time the student is
   flagged. It is expected to improve students' achievement and success,
   and it could also have positive impacts on under-performing students,
   educators, and academic institutions in general.},

Abstract = {Evaluating User Experience (UX) is not a trivial task, and UX
   specialists have used a variety of tools to analyze data collected from
   user tests, which causes difficulty in synchronizing the data. This
   paper presents UXmood, a tool that condenses multiple distinct data
   types (audio, video, text, and eye-tracking) in a dashboard of
   coordinated visualizations to ease the analysis process and allow to
   manage several projects where each project has several logs of user
   interaction. The tool replays sessions of tests and uses a combination
   of different sentiment analysis techniques to present a suggestion of
   user sentiment at any given time during the tasks. The visualizations
   support brushing and details-on-demand interactions and are synchronized
   with a temporal slider, allowing analysts to see specific moments of the
   tests freely. Also, the uses of the sentiment analysis in the collected
   data may improved the qualitative analysis of UX.},

Title = {Advancing equity and inclusion in educational practices with AI-powered
   educational decision support systems (AI-EDSS)},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1974-1981},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {A key goal of educational institutions around the world is to provide
   inclusive, equitable quality education and lifelong learning
   opportunities for all learners. Achieving this requires contextualized
   approaches to accommodate diverse global values and promote learning
   opportunities that best meet the needs and goals of all learners as
   individuals and members of different communities. Advances in learning
   analytics (LA), natural language processes (NLP), and artificial
   intelligence (AI), especially generative AI technologies, offer
   potential to aid educational decision making by supporting analytic
   insights and personalized recommendations. However, these technologies
   also raise serious risks for reinforcing or exacerbating existing
   inequalities; these dangers arise from multiple factors including biases
   represented in training datasets, the technologies' abilities to take
   autonomous decisions, and processes for tool development that do not
   centre the needs and concerns of historically marginalized groups. To
   ensure that Educational Decision Support Systems (EDSS), particularly
   AI-powered ones, are equipped to promote equity, they must be created
   and evaluated holistically, considering their potential for both
   targeted and systemic impacts on all learners, especially members of
   historically marginalized groups. Adopting a socio-technical and
   cultural perspective is crucial for designing, deploying, and evaluating
   AI-EDSS that truly advance educational equity and inclusion. This
   editorial introduces the contributions of five papers for the special
   section on advancing equity and inclusion in educational practices with
   AI-EDSS. These papers focus on (i) a review of biases in large language
   models (LLMs) applications offers practical guidelines for their
   evaluation to promote educational equity, (ii) techniques to mitigate
   disparities across countries and languages in LLMs representation of
   educationally relevant knowledge, (iii) implementing equitable and
   intersectionality-aware machine learning applications in education, (iv)
   introducing a LA dashboard that aims to promote institutional equality,
   diversity, and inclusion, and (v) vulnerable student digital well-being
   in AI-EDSS. Together, these contributions underscore the importance of
   an interdisciplinary approach in developing and utilizing AI-EDSS to not
   only foster a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape
   worldwide but also reveal a critical need for a broader
   contextualization of equity that incorporates the socio-technical
   questions of what kinds of decisions AI is being used to support, for
   what purposes, and whose goals are prioritized in this process.},

Abstract = {With the proliferation of MOOCs and the large amount of data collected,
   a lot of questions have been asked about their value and effectiveness.
   One of the key issues emerging is the difficulty in the sense-making
   from the data available. The use of analytic dashboards has been
   suggested to provide quick insights and distil the large volume of
   learner interaction data generated. These dashboards hold the promise of
   providing a contextualized view of data and facilitating useful research
   exploration. However, little has been done in defining how these
   dashboards should be created, often resulting in a proliferation of
   systems for each new research agenda. We present our experience of
   building MOOC dashboards for two different platforms, namely Coursera
   and FutureLearn, motivated by a set of design goals with input from a
   diverse set of stakeholders. We demonstrate the features of the system
   and how it has served to make data accessible and useable. We report on
   problems faced, drawing on analyses of think-aloud sessions conducted
   with real educators, which have informed our dashboard process.},

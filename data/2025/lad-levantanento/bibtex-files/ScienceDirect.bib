abstract = {A vast number of studies reported exciting innovations and practices in the field of Learning Analytics (LA). Whilst they provided substantial insights, most of these studies have been implemented in single-course or small-scale settings. There are only a few studies that are large-scale and institutional-wide adaptations of LA and have explored the stakeholders' perspectives (i.e., teachers, students, researchers, management) and involvement with LA. This study reports on one such large-scale and long-term implementation of Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA) spanning a period of 4 years at a distance learning university. OU Analyse (OUA) is the PLA system used in this study, providing predictive insights to teachers about students and their chance of passing a course. Over the last 4 years, OUA has been accessed by 1159 unique teachers and reached 23,180 students in 231 undergraduate online courses. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to reflect on the macro-level of adoption by detailing usage, challenges, and factors facilitating adoption at an organisational level, and (b) to detail the micro-level of adoption, that is the teachers' perspectives about OUA. Amongst the factors shown to be critical to the scalable PLA implementation were: Faculty's engagement with OUA, teachers as “champions”, evidence generation and dissemination, digital literacy, and conceptions about teaching online.}

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of these dashboards and few designs are informed by theory. Many dashboard designs struggle to translate awareness of learning processes into actual self-regulated learning. In this study we investigate a Learning Analytics dashboard based on existing evidence on social comparison to support motivation, metacognition and academic achievement. Motivation plays a key role in whether learners will engage in self-regulated learning in the first place. Social comparison can be a significant driver in increasing motivation. We performed two randomised controlled interventions in different higher-education courses, one of which took place online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students were shown their current and predicted performance in a course alongside that of peers with similar goal grades. The sample of peers was selected in a way to elicit slight upward comparison. We found that the dashboard successfully promotes extrinsic motivation and leads to higher academic achievement, indicating an effect of dashboard exposure on learning behaviour, despite an absence of effects on metacognition. These results provide evidence that carefully designed social comparison, rooted in theory and empirical evidence, can be used to boost motivation and performance. Our dashboard is a successful example of how social comparison can be implemented in Learning Analytics Dashboards.}

We characterize the reviewed literature based on three dimensions: (a) connection with visualization background; (b) connection with educational theory; and (c) sophistication of visualization(s). The results from this systematic review suggest that: (1) little work has been done to bring visual learning analytics tools into classroom settings; (2) few studies consider background information from the students, such as demographics or prior performance; (3) traditional statistical visualization techniques, such as bar plots and scatter plots, are still the most commonly used in learning analytics contexts, while more advanced or novel techniques are rarely used; (4) while some studies employ sophisticated visualizations, and some engage deeply with educational theories, there is a lack of studies that both employ sophisticated visualizations and engage deeply with educational theories.

abstract = {Background
While the application of learning analytics in tertiary education has received increasing attention in recent years, a much smaller number have explored its use in health care-related educational studies.
Objective
This systematic review aims to examine the use of e-learning analytics data in health care studies with regards to how the analytics is reported and if there is a relationship between e-learning analytics and learning outcomes.
Methods
We performed comprehensive searches of papers from 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and ERIC) to identify relevant papers. Qualitative studies were excluded from this review. Papers were screened by 2 independent reviewers. We selected qualified studies for further investigation.
Results
A total of 537 papers were screened, and 19 papers were identified. With regards to analytics undertaken, 11 studies reported the number of connections and time spent on e-learning. Learning outcome measures were defined by summative final assessment marks or grades. In addition, significant statistical results of the relationships between e-learning usage and learning outcomes were reported in 12 of the identified papers. In general, students who engaged more in e-learning resources would get better academic attainments. However, 2 papers reported otherwise with better performing students consuming less e-learning videos. A total of 14 papers utilized satisfaction questionnaires for students, and all were positive in their attitude toward e-learning. Furthermore, 6 of 19 papers reported descriptive statistics only, with no statistical analysis.
Conclusions
The nature of e-learning activities reported in this review was varied and not detailed well. In addition, there appeared to be inadequate reporting of learning analytics data observed in over half of the selected papers with regards to definitions and lack of detailed information of what the analytic was recording. Although learning analytics data capture is popular, a lack of detail is apparent with regards to the capturing of meaningful and comparable data. In particular, most analytics record access to a management system or particular e-learning materials, which may not necessarily detail meaningful learning time or interaction. Hence, learning analytics data should be designed to record the time spent on learning and focus on key learning activities. Finally, recommendations are made for future studies.}

The results suggest that it is imperative for learning analytics research to account for the diverse ways technology is adopted and applied in course-specific contexts. The differences in technology use, especially those related to whether and how learners use the learning management system, require consideration before the log-data can be merged to create a generalized model for predicting academic success. A lack of attention to instructional conditions can lead to an over or under estimation of the effects of LMS features on students' academic success.

abstract = {Purpose
Although big data analytics (BDA) have great benefits for higher education institutions (HEIs), due to lack of sufficient evidence on how BDA investment can pay off, it is tough for HEIs practitioners to realize value from such adoption. The purpose of this paper is to propose a big data academic and learning analytics enabled business value model to explain BDA potential benefits and business value which can be obtained by developing such analytics capabilities in HEIs.
Design/methodology/approach
The study examined 47 case descriptions from 26 HEIs to investigate the causal association between the BDA current and potential benefits and business value creation path for big data academic and learning analytics success in HEIs.
Findings
The pressure of compliance with all legal and regulatory requirements and competition had pushed HEIs hard to adopt BDA tools. However, the study found out that application of risk and security and predictive analytics to higher education fields is still in its infancy. Using this theoretical model, the results provide new insights to higher education administrators on ways to create BDA capabilities for HEIs transformation and suggest an empirical foundation that can lead to more thorough analysis of BDA implementation.
Originality/value
A distinctive theoretical contribution of this study is its conceptualization of understanding business value from BDA in the typical setting of higher education. The study provides HEIs with an all-inclusive understanding of BDA and gives insights on how it helps to transform HEIs. The new perspectives associated with the big data academic and learning analytics enabled business value model will contribute to future research in this area.}

Guided by Winne and Hadwin's COPES model (1998), SRL was operationalized at a coarse level with students' online log data and course assessment scores representing their SRL operations and products of SRL in the course, respectively. Results of mixed ANOVAs and chi-square tests of independence showed that the LA-based feedback enhanced students' completion rate of online learning activities and their study regularity. The treatment group exhibited superior performance in the final examination compared to the comparison group, providing evidence of the positive impact of LA-based feedback on students' course performance.

Qualitative data was obtained from 37 interviews with managers and 16 focus groups with 51 teaching staff and 45 students, whereas quantitative data was obtained from surveys answered by 1884 students and 368 teaching staff. According to the triangulation of both types of evidence, we found that (1) students need quality feedback and timely support, (2) teaching staff need timely alerts and meaningful performance evaluations, and (3) managers need quality information to implement support interventions.

While many value the potential of learning analytics, it is not without critics, especially with regards to ethical concerns surrounding the level and type of data gathered, and scepticism on data's ability to measure something useful and actionable. This paper gathers the thoughts of key stakeholders, including staff and students, and their expectations of learning analytics, their priorities for using student data, and how they should be supported to act on the data, with the aim of aiding institutions with their plans to implement learning analytics. For this analysis we explored stakeholder awareness, concerns, priorities and support needs with respect to effectively accessing, interpreting and utilising learning data through the use of surveys and focus groups. These were adapted from the previously published SHEILA framework protocols with additional topics added relating to awareness, uses of data, and support. The focus groups were used to capture prevalent themes, followed by surveys to gain perspectives on these themes from a wider stakeholder audience. Overall, results suggest there are significant differences in the perspectives of each of the stakeholders. There is also a strong need for both additional training and ongoing support to manage and realise stakeholder understanding and goals around learning analytics. Further research is necessary to explore the needs of a greater diversity of stakeholders.}

The underlying untested assumption is that providing analytics will be sufficient to improve self-regulated learning. Working within a feedback recipience framework, we begin to test this assumption by examining the impact of learning analytics messages on student affect and academic resilience. Three hundred and twenty undergraduate students completed an online survey and were exposed to three randomly assigned learning analytics alerts (High Distinction, Pass, and Fail grades). Multivariate analyses of variance indicated significant differences between grade levels (large effects), with higher positive affect and lower resilience in response to High Distinction alerts than Pass or Fail alerts. Within each hypothetical grade level, there were no differences in student affect and academic resilience. Based upon systematic changes in feedback sender, message style or whether comparative peer achievement was included or not. These findings indicate that grade level has the largest impact on both affect and academic resilience. The failure of message and sender characteristics to impact on activities that promote self-regulated learning suggests we need to look beyond these characteristics of individual messages to identify drivers of engaging students in self-regulated learning.}

This experiment examined the relationship between children's age and their aesthetic preferences towards visual complexity in e-learning web pages designed for them. It applied Berlyne's theory of aesthetic preference: a theory that suggests that people prefer a medium level of stimuli to a low or high level of stimuli. It asked 180 Taiwanese primary school children to indicate their aesthetic preferences towards web pages of high, medium and low visual complexity. The children were divided into three groups: 7-8 year-olds, 9-10 year-olds and 11-12 year-olds. When the ratings of the three age groups were looked at together, they revealed that the children preferred e-learning web pages that had a medium level of visual complexity to those that had a high or low level of visual complexity. As such, the results supported Berlyne's theory. However, when the ratings of the age groups were looked at separately with respect to aesthetic factors, differences were found. In particular, it was found that the 7-8 year-olds preferred e-learning web pages that had a high level of colourfulness while the 9-12 year-olds did not.}

abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) offers new opportunities to enrich feedback practices in higher education, but little is understood about the ways different LA can enhance feedback practices for educators and students. This systematic literature review maps the current state of implementation of LA to improve feedback practices in technology-mediated learning environments in higher education. We used strict inclusion criteria to select relevant studies that have investigated the role of LA on feedback practices. To identify common features of LA for feedback studies, we coded relevant publications using an analytical framework that identifies four key dimensions of LA systems: what (types of data), how (analytic methods), why (objectives), and how educators and students are served by LA (stakeholders). Based on findings, we propose a conceptual framework that can guide the implementation of LA for feedback systems and also suggest future empirical research in this area.}

Individual visualizations can be used to check on the learning styles of students based on all the indicators available. ALAS-KA visualizations help teachers and students to make decisions in the learning process. The paper presents some guidelines and examples to help teachers make these decisions based on data from undergraduate courses, where ALAS-KA was installed.

Focusing on three key activities (analytic access, sensemaking, and action-taking), this study employed a mixed-methods approach, analyzing analytics access and action records from 91 students and think-aloud interviews with 10 students. Findings revealed consistently high access rates (i.e. opening an email that included analytics) across all weeks; however, more substantive engagement with the analytics varied based on alignment with students’ learning routines and motivations for use. Students engaged in information-seeking based on curiosity about peer activity but noted a tension between their desire for concise data representations and the need for sufficient context to interpret and evaluate the information. Students did not always act immediately and directly on the analytics, but instead demonstrated indirect changes in their learning behaviors, such as heightened awareness and behavioral adjustments during later collaborative tasks. These insights inform a contextualized model of student analytics use, offering guidance for future analytics design and research and suggesting the need for an expanded notion of analytic actionability.}

Therefore, we analyze and cluster the usage patterns of 9th and 10th graders in a web-based learning platform called I3Learn. The platform focuses on chemistry learning, and UDL principles guide its design. We collected the temporal usage patterns of UDL-guided elements of 384 learners in detailed log files. The collected data includes the time spent using video and/or text as a source of information, working on learning tasks with or without help and working on self-assessments. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify relevant factors in the observed usage behaviors. Based on the factor loadings, we extracted features for k-means clustering and named the resulting groups based on their usage patterns and learner characteristics. The EFA revealed four factors suggesting that learners remain consistent in selecting UDL-guided elements that require a decision (video or text, tasks with or without help). Based on these four factors, the cluster analysis identifies six different groups. We discuss these results as a starting point to provide individualized learning support through further artificial intelligence applications and inform educators about learner activity through a dashboard.}

While researchers have successfully used learning analytics, for instance, to improve student retention and learning design, the topic of privacy in learning analytics from students' perspectives requires further investigation. Specifically, there are mixed results in the literature as to whether students are concerned about privacy in learning analytics. Understanding students' privacy concern, or lack of privacy concern, can contribute to successful implementation of learning analytics applications in higher education institutions. This paper reports on a study carried out to understand whether students are concerned about the collection, use and sharing of their data for learning analytics, and what contributes to their perspectives. Students in a laboratory session (n = 111) were shown vignettes describing data use in a university and an e-commerce company. The aim was to determine students' concern about their data being collected, used and shared with third parties, and whether their concern differed between the two contexts. Students' general privacy concerns and behaviours were also examined and compared to their privacy concern specific to learning analytics. We found that students in the study were more comfortable with the collection, use and sharing of their data in the university context than in the e-commerce context. Furthermore, these students were more concerned about their data being shared with third parties in the e-commerce context than in the university context. Thus, the study findings contribute to deepening our understanding about what raises students’ privacy concern in the collection, use and sharing of their data for learning analytics. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on and the practice of ethical learning analytics.}

However, little has been done to examine different patterns of students with different SRL profiles over time, which precludes providing optimal on-going instructional support for individual students. To address the gap in research, we applied learning analytics to analyze log data from 284 undergraduate students enrolled in an asynchronous online statistics course. Specifically, we identified student SRL profiles, and examined the actual student SRL learning patterns. The k-medoids clustering identified three self-regulated learning profiles: self-regulation, partial self-regulation, and non-self-regulation. Self-regulated students showed more study regularity and help-seeking, than did the other two groups of students. The partially self-regulated students showed high study regularity but inactive help-seeking, while the non-self-regulated students exhibited less study regularity and less frequent help-seeking than the other two groups; their self-reported time management scores were significantly lower. The analysis of each week's log variables using the random forest algorithm revealed that self-regulated students studied course content early before exams and sought help during the general exam period, whereas non-self-regulated students studied the course content during the general exam period. Based on our findings, we provide instructional strategies that can be used to support student SRL. We also discuss implications of this study for advanced learning analytics research, and the design of effective asynchronous online courses.}

Further, DE practitioners face challenges in understanding whether (and for whom) such interventions work, due to small sample sizes, short intervention durations, and the inherent uniqueness of each dissertation. This methodological paper proposes a novel, practice-oriented, and idiographic approach to such understanding, supported by learning analytics of quantitative and qualitative data. To illustrate this approach, we apply it to two datasets from six authentic doctoral workshops (N = 105 doctoral students), showcasing how it can provide individualized practice-oriented insights to doctoral students and help trainers better understand their interventions, while coping with typical limitations of data from doctoral training. These findings exemplify how the triangulation of simple, interpretable analytics models of mixed longitudinal data can improve students, practitioners', and researchers' understanding, re-design, and personalization of such training actions.
Educational relevance and implications statement
Collecting data about the context and process of a doctoral training action can help practitioners and students understand who benefits more (or less) from such training. The individualized analysis of such data, obtained with even very simple technologies, can also help students understand their processes and contexts, to better address progress and well-being issues. The use of student-authored short narratives (e.g., diaries), along with longitudinal quantitative data, plays an important role in these personalized analyses, and the promise of automated qualitative coding makes this approach increasingly feasible.}

These features include different graphical representations of the design decision inputs and performance outputs. Participants were first asked to use their assigned dashboard to design a catapult system that maximizes launch distance while meeting requirements related to height, weight, and cost. Following the design task, they were asked a series of questions about their experiences with the dashboard and their understanding of the catapult model. A between-subjects analysis then evaluated how the dashboard design influenced various outcomes of interest. The results show that students who used the most feature-rich dashboard did not perform objectively better than those with the most feature-sparse dashboard, though their self-reported performance was higher. The performance of female versus male participants was also compared, with no significant differences found. The findings support the notion that dashboards should be designed with minimal features to convey the necessary information, and they also point out the disconnect between objective performance and user-assessed performance with interactive dashboards.}

Results indicate that LADA enables expert advisers to evaluate significantly more scenarios (Median = 2), especially for high advising difficulty cases with students that failed many courses (MedianA=3,MedianB=2.5), in a not-significantly different amount of time. For inexperienced advisers, LADA is perceived as a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient decision-making, as they were able to make informed decisions in a similar amount of time compared to the experts.

abstract = {Background
Digital education has expanded since the COVID-19 pandemic began. A substantial amount of recent data on how students learn has become available for learning analytics (LA). LA denotes the “measurement, collection, analysis, and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimizing learning and the environments in which it occurs.”
Objective
This scoping review aimed to examine the use of LA in health care professions education and propose a framework for the LA life cycle.
Methods
We performed a comprehensive literature search of 10 databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ICTP, Scopus, and IEEE Explore. In total, 6 reviewers worked in pairs and performed title, abstract, and full-text screening. We resolved disagreements on study selection by consensus and discussion with other reviewers. We included papers if they met the following criteria: papers on health care professions education, papers on digital education, and papers that collected LA data from any type of digital education platform.
Results
We retrieved 1238 papers, of which 65 met the inclusion criteria. From those papers, we extracted some typical characteristics of the LA process and proposed a framework for the LA life cycle, including digital education content creation, data collection, data analytics, and the purposes of LA. Assignment materials were the most popular type of digital education content (47/65, 72%), whereas the most commonly collected data types were the number of connections to the learning materials (53/65, 82%). Descriptive statistics was mostly used in data analytics in 89% (58/65) of studies. Finally, among the purposes for LA, understanding learners’ interactions with the digital education platform was cited most often in 86% (56/65) of papers and understanding the relationship between interactions and student performance was cited in 63% (41/65) of papers. Far less common were the purposes of optimizing learning: the provision of at-risk intervention, feedback, and adaptive learning was found in 11, 5, and 3 papers, respectively.
Conclusions
We identified gaps for each of the 4 components of the LA life cycle, with the lack of an iterative approach while designing courses for health care professions being the most prevalent. We identified only 1 instance in which the authors used knowledge from a previous course to improve the next course. Only 2 studies reported that LA was used to detect at-risk students during the course’s run, compared with the overwhelming majority of other studies in which data analysis was performed only after the course was completed.}

To identify the main characteristics of SLA, gaps and future opportunities for this emerging approach, we systematically identified and analyzed 36 SLA-related studies conducted between 2011 and 2020. We focus on SLA implementation and methodological characteristics, educational focus, and the studies’ theoretical perspectives. The results show the predominance of SLA in formal and fully online settings with social network analysis (SNA) a dominant analytical technique. Most SLA studies aimed to understand students’ learning processes and applied the social constructivist perspective as a lens to interpret students’ learning behaviors. However, (i) few studies involve teachers in developing SLA tools, and rarely share SLA visualizations with teachers to support teaching decisions; (ii) some SLA studies are atheoretical; and (iii) the number of SLA studies integrating more than one analytical approach remains limited. Moreover, (iv) few studies leveraged innovative network approaches (e.g., epistemic network analysis, multimodal network analysis), and (v) studies rarely focused on temporal patterns of students’ interactions to assess how students’ social and knowledge networks evolve over time. Based on the findings and the gaps identified, we present methodological, theoretical and practical recommendations for conducting research and creating tools that can advance the field of SLA.}

Graduate students (n = 36) from three different online courses used their own mobile devices to track how much time they devoted to learn over a period of four months. Repeated measures of the Online Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire and Validity and Reliability of Time Management Questionnaire were taken along the course. Our findings reveal positive effects of tracking time on time management skills. Variations in the channel, content and timing of the mobile notifications to foster reflective practice are investigated, and time-logging patterns are described. These results not only provide evidence of the benefits of recording learning time, but also suggest relevant cues on how mobile notifications should be designed and prompted towards self-regulated learning of students in online courses.}

Learning analytics dashboards (LADs), a data-enhanced feedback tool that allows students to make sense of their learning by providing insights into their learning behaviours represents one of the prominent examples of this trend. While these visualisation tools are increasingly used to study and enhance students' learning in academic contexts, current research is limited regarding the effects of the LADs in K-12 environments. There is a missed opportunity to empower teams and allow instructors and researchers to understand how teams use the LAD to regulate their learning. In this study, we developed a K-12 LAD for supporting students' collaborative work and evaluated with respect to students' perceived usefulness of the proposed LAD and the association between its use and course performance. The study followed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of log data from the dashboard and qualitative analysis of students’ perceptions using surveys and focus groups. Our results show that different roles within teams have distinguished engagement patterns with the LAD and that the tool improves the collaborative learning experience. We postulate that the implications of this study will aid future research work when investigating the behaviours of teams and optimising their learning using LADs.}

The effectiveness of the dashboards was examined in a university class with 88 students (56 females, 32 males) for 4 weeks. The dashboards significantly improved the FCA process and outcomes, encouraging students to actively participate in FCA and create high-quality arguments. Students had a positive attitude toward the dashboard and perceived it as useful and easy to use.

In the present study, a human-centered approach was employed to design an instructor dashboard. The design processes and illustrative prototypes are presented, along with the features participant instructors perceived to be the most and least helpful. The integration of a human-centered approach to guide the processes involved in designing actionable instructor dashboards is also discussed. Three components of a human centered approach are recommended: (a) designing with multiple stakeholders, (b) aligning pedagogy with analytics, and (c) training on data use. This research contributes to the field by demonstrating how human-centered design can bridge the gap between technological potentials and pedagogical features in instructor dashboards, ultimately leading to effective integration of such tools in higher education classrooms.}

While this has made it possible to predict retention, flags students at risk and more clearly assesses performance across a range of indicators, few benefits visible to students have resulted. Recent attempts to design learner-facing analytics seem to also have met with indifferent results as they appear to have neglected to focus on student personality and motivation or to train students appropriately to decipher LA-based feedback. The aim of this study is to investigate why current Learning Analytics (LA) systems have so little impact on student motivation. A further goal has been to scrutinize the latest research for potential grounding in theoretical concepts generally – but with emphasis on motivation. Results show that, with few exceptions, neither instructor- nor learner-facing LA currently in use at universities take into consideration student personalities as neither are grounded in appropriate theory. This study contributes to the field of LA and Motivation by providing a clear (if bleak) picture of the lack of focus on student personality and motivation in terms of LA feedback. It is, therefore, timely that to remind the research community that an understanding of the learner’s personality, attributes, and sources of motivation is central to the effectiveness of any feedback design. We see this paper as a starting point for a much-needed deeper discussion.}

Therefore, optical focus variation metrology is used to measure gears inline. Afterward, the evaluation of measurement results based on trained models and the transfer of correction parameters back to the machine tool through control algorithms are established. Critical parameters of the manufacturing process are identified through preliminary tests, which are varied using Latin Hypercube Sampling. The resulting experimental plan defines manipulated deviations for manufacturing 200 sample gears representing production variations. The evaluation according to parameter-based gear deviations enables the modeling of influencing quantities using machine learning. This information provides a control algorithm for the feedback of correction values to the machine tool based on data analyses. After validation, it is shown that the current state of measurement technology enables the inline quality control of micro-components. The final control loop achieved accuracies in the micrometer range at detection levels of over 90%. Consequently, these results form a basis for implementing future adaptive quality control loops within data-driven production.}

Results showed that experienced institutions demonstrated more interest in exploring learning behaviour and pedagogical reformation than simply measuring a phenomenon. Experienced institutions also paid more attention to methodological approaches to LA than data constraints, and demonstrated a broader involvement of teachers and students. This paper also identifies inter-related connections between prevailing challenges that impede the scaling of LA. Based on the results, we suggest regular evaluations of LA adoption to ensure the alignment of strategy and desired changes. We also identify three areas that require particular attention when forming short-term goals for LA at different phases of adoption}

We modeled how changes in student motivation and self-regulated learning (SRL) were related to what occurred during 1-on-1 meetings with academic advisors during which students had the potential to view representations of their achievement embedded within an Early Warning System (EWS) that visually represented aspects of their academic performance referenced with course averages. Constructs associated with SRL were moderated by advisor-advisee meetings. Results indicated that advisors' use of EWS while they met with students was negatively associated with the rate of decrease of students' reporting of using memorizing strategies but positively related when students' performance was compared to that of their peers. We discuss the moderating effects of students’ exposure to visualizations of academic performance on their SRL strategies and academic motivation. This study points to the importance of monitoring the effects of information presented via EWS on motivation and SRL.}

Educational games offer promising advantages for assessment; personalised feedback to students and automated assessment process. However, while many teachers agree that educational games increase motivation, learning and retention, few of them are ready to fully trust them as an assessment tool. We believe there are two main reasons for this lack of trust: educators are not given sufficient information about the gameplays, and many educational games are distributed as black-boxes, unmodifiable by teachers. This paper presents an assessment engine designed to separate a game and its assessment. It allows teachers to modify a game’s assessment after distribution and visualise gameplay data via a learning analytics dashboard. The engine was evaluated quantitatively by 31 educators. Findings were overall very positive: both the assessment editor and the learning analytics dashboard were rated useful and easy to use. The evaluation also indicates that, having access to EngAGe, educators would be more likely to trust a game’s assessment. This paper concludes that EngAGe can be used by educators effectively to modify educational games’ assessment and visualise gameplay data, and that it contributes to increasing their trust in educational games as an assessment tool.}

Failure to do so may lead to services reflecting ideological gaps, which will inadvertently create dissatisfaction among its users.

Furthermore, there has been no attempt to explore whether students can be segmented into different groups based on their expectations towards learning analytics services. In doing so, it allows for a greater understanding of what is and is not expected from learning analytics services within a sample of students. The current exploratory work addresses this limitation by using the three-step approach to latent class analysis to understand whether student expectations of learning analytics services can clearly be segmented, using self-report data obtained from a sample of students at an Open University in the Netherlands. The findings show that student expectations regarding ethical and privacy elements of a learning analytics service are consistent across all groups; however, those expectations of service features are quite variable.

This study investigated changes in students’ academic motivation orientations over the course of one bridge program, and how a learning analytics-based intervention was employed by academic advisors to inform their face-to-face meetings with students. The results of our study show that students’ mastery orientation decreased over the course of the bridge program, and indicate that students’ exposure to displays of their academic performance negatively predicts this change.

However, few studies have examined the effects of such applications on at-risk students. Elements of Success is a learning analytics platform that provides students with weekly performance feedback, including a current estimated grade. This study examined the relationship between student use of Elements of Success and academic performance among at-risk students in an introductory chemistry course. Specifically, we compared final grade outcomes and the risk of withdrawal among students who received a low estimated grade after the first midterm. Results indicated that viewing performance feedback, including a low estimated grade, was not associated with withdrawal from the course for at-risk students. Furthermore, at-risk students who used Elements of Success were found to be resilient. After controlling for prior learning outcomes, demographics, and self-reported study skills, it was found that they were more likely to earn a final passing grade (C- or above) than at-risk students who never used it.

Three aspects are described: first, we present the timeline of the case study and zoom in on how the macro-level of the institution (where the groundwork is laid to facilitate AI-systems in education) and the micro-level of the implementation of the system influenced each other. Second, we describe which stakeholders were involved and what their ethical considerations were concerning data management, algorithms, and pedagogy. Third, we describe the initial evaluation of the dashboard in terms of study advisors’ experiences and provide suggestions on how to stimulate the responsible and useful implementation of a predictive modelling tool.}

abstract = {Our contemporary society demands highly qualified professionals in all sectors, and education serves as the keystone for achieving this goal. While educational institutions are diligently preparing their students to thrive in this context, emphasizing inclusivity across all demographics is crucial. An essential group in this regard comprises students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (IDDs), who require tailored tasks, content, and activities to facilitate their learning. A crucial consideration is facilitating their success in education, and in this context, Learning Analytics (LA) emerges as a potential solution. LA aims to optimize students' learning experiences by gathering and analyzing their data in order to facilitate better interventions. However, it is imperative to ascertain whether LA has been effectively utilized with IDD students. To address this issue, this research project proposes a Systematic Literature Review, considering six of the most relevant scientific works sources, and identifying 364 studies. These studies underwent meticulous filtering and evaluation, resulting in 28 records which specifically address the use of LA with IDD students. Insights gained from the review indicate that the application of LA in the learning experiences of IDD students is viable. However, it necessitates careful consideration of factors such as students’ difficulties and special characteristics, learning contexts, and the available resources to construct effective learning interventions.}

However, little is understood about how network-monitoring dashboard designs impact user experience in an augmented virtuality (AV) environment. Our study proposes that a dashboard design showing variations in selected elements can impact the network-monitoring flow experience of users by affecting their enjoyment, concentration, and control, which in turn can influence their performance in critical, complex, and time-sensitive environments. To investigate this phenomenon, we design and evaluate two narrative visualization user interfaces—a designer-driven (DD) design and a user-driven (UD) design—in the context of network-monitoring dashboards. Adding vivid and familiar real-world objects may enhance perceived realism; thus, we integrate AV with the two dashboard designs (i.e., DD and UD) and evaluate their effect on user flow experience and performance. Results suggest that the flow experience of users will lead to positive perceived performance. A nonlinear relationship between AV and dashboard design, and the UD design with a moderate AV level can improve user flow experience and performance compared with the DD design. When the AV level is nonexistent or excessive, the superior effect of the UD design disappears. Lastly, we discuss practical implications and theoretical contributions, along with future research directions.}

In this study, we focused on a unique sub-group of MOOC learners – retakers who take the same TPD MOOC multiple times. In the empirical study reported in this paper, we examined what learning strategies they choose when taking a TPD MOOC and the extent to which they are able to adapt their learning strategies to improve their performance in the subsequent attempts. By using learning analytic methods, we detected five learning strategies and eight major forms of strategy change adapted by MOOC retakers. We found that two strategy changes (from Content-Oriented Strategy to Intensive-Thorough Strategy or Balanced Strategy) with associated with significantly higher performance in the subsequent attempts compared to no change in strategy. Our findings have implications for MOOC instructors and providers about the ways they can support MOOC retakers. Our findings also suggest that MOOCs are not only valuable TPD resources for teachers, but they also have unique opportunities for strengthening the self-regulation skills of teacher learners as the “by-products of learning”.}

An inherent catalyst of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is internal feedback, the new knowledge which is generated when comparing current knowledge against reference information. Learners may not always generate internal feedback, hampering further SRL. Supporting SRL can be done with a Learning Analytics Dashboard (LAD), in which reference frames allow for comparisons and facilitate internal feedback generation. This study explores internal feedback generation using a LAD and the effect of reference frame availability. A multiple method design examined the interplay of reference frames, comparison processes, internal feedback generation and preparatory activities engagement. Differences between three conditions were explored using Bain ANOVA’s. Results showed that reference frames almost exclude other external comparators and are used in parallel with an internal comparator. A peer reference frame leads to most verbalizations of internal feedback, and potentially to most verbalizations of preparatory activities.}

This empirical contribution provides an application of Buckingham Shum and Deakin Crick’s theoretical framework of dispositional learning analytics: an infrastructure that combines learning dispositions data with data extracted from computer-assisted, formative assessments and LMSs. In a large introductory quantitative methods module, 922 students were enrolled in a module based on the principles of blended learning, combining face-to-face problem-based learning sessions with e-tutorials. We investigated the predictive power of learning dispositions, outcomes of continuous formative assessments and other system generated data in modelling student performance of and their potential to generate informative feedback. Using a dynamic, longitudinal perspective, computer-assisted formative assessments seem to be the best predictor for detecting underperforming students and academic performance, while basic LMS data did not substantially predict learning. If timely feedback is crucial, both use-intensity related track data from e-tutorial systems, and learning dispositions, are valuable sources for feedback generation.}

This study implemented an educational game on collaborative problem solving (CPS) and a GLA system for assisting K–12 teachers in evaluating students’ CPS skills and processes and quest performance and engagement. Based on the integrative model of behavioural prediction, this study aimed to examine 1) the extent to which personal, environmental, and technological factors affected teachers’ usage intention and behaviour towards the GLA system, 2) the effects of moderators on the intention–behaviour relationship, and 3) how the structural model relationships differed across teachers with various individual characteristics. Survey data from 300 in-service teachers from Chinese primary and secondary schools were collected and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Results indicated that our model demonstrated strong in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power. In particular, teachers’ attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy influenced their behavioural intention, while technological pedagogical content knowledge, school support, and behavioural intention predicted their actual behaviour. In addition, technostress acted as a significant moderator of the intention–behaviour relationship. Moreover, teachers’ gaming preferences, teaching subjects, and years of teaching explained the heterogeneity of their GLA usage. This study contributes to a theoretical understanding of and methodological advancements in studying teachers’ usage intention and behaviour on GLA and yields practical implications for the design and implementation of GLA in K–12 classrooms.}

We conducted a systematic literature review to explore these concerns and gaps. We analysed 108 papers to provide insights about i) the current state of human-centred LA/AIED research; ii) the extent to which educational stakeholders have contributed to the design process of human-centred LA/AIED systems; iii) the current balance between human control and computer automation of such systems; and iv) the extent to which safety, reliability and trustworthiness have been considered in the literature. Results indicate some consideration of human control in LA/AIED system design, but limited end-user involvement in actual design. Based on these findings, we recommend: 1) carefully balancing stakeholders' involvement in designing and deploying LA/AIED systems throughout all design phases 2) actively involving target end-users, especially students, to delineate the balance between human control and automation, and 3) exploring safety, reliability, and trustworthiness as principles in future human-centred LA/AIED systems.}

Participants were 51 Taiwanese graduate students in blended Statistics courses under the PBL pedagogy. The multimodal Learning Analytics (LA) model contained data from learner discourse on Facebook groups and questionnaires, including learner characteristics, perceived digital distraction, subjective peer learning orientation, and objective peer learning engagement endorsed by machine learning (ML) models. Results showed that students reporting more digital distraction problems obtained lower final course grades, and those reporting stronger peer learning orientation received higher final course grades. Moreover, peer learning engagement objectively recognized by ML models has better predictive validity on academic performance than self-perceived peer learning orientation. The results of the multimodal LA models addressed the scarcity of studies involving learners' process data in PBL and informed instructional practices and strategies to scaffold students’ statistics learning upon detecting those at risk of distracted attention problems and poor peer learning engagement.}

We investigated how learner goals and self-regulated learning (SRL) skills influence dashboard sense-making following a mixed-methods research methodology: a qualitative pre-study followed-up with an extensive quantitative study with 247 university students. We uncovered three latent variables for sense-making: transparency of design, reference frames and support for action. SRL skills are predictors for how relevant students find these constructs.

At the course level, the combination of predictive analytics and self-regulation theory can help instructors determine the best study advice and allow learners to better self-regulate and determine how they want to learn. The best performing techniques are often black-box models that favor performance over interpretability and are heavily influenced by course contexts. In this study, we argue that explainable AI has the potential not only to uncover the reasons behind model decisions, but also to reveal their stability across contexts, effectively bridging the gap between predictive and explanatory learning analytics (LA). In contributing to decision support systems research, this study (1) leverages traditional techniques, such as concept drift and performance drift, to investigate the stability of student success prediction models over time; (2) uses Shapley Additive explanations in a novel way to explore the stability of extracted feature importance rankings generated for these models; (3) generates new insights that emerge from stable features across cohorts, enabling teachers to determine study advice. We believe this study makes a strong contribution to education research at large and expands the field of LA by augmenting the interpretability and explainability of prediction algorithms and ensuring their applicability in changing contexts.}

The design artefact presented in this article uses a conceptual model that visualizes the relationships between dashboard design and the learning sciences to provide cognitive and behavioral process-oriented feedback to learners and teachers to support regulation of learning.

In this paper, we discuss how to apply Learning Analytics (LA) with assessment purposes, studying how students interact with games. One of the biggest barriers for this approach is the variety of videogames, with many genres and types. This makes it difficult to create a comprehensive LA model for educational games that can be generally applied. In order to maintain manageable costs, we propose a two-step approach to apply LA: we first identify simple generic traces and reports that could be applied to any kind of game, and then build game-specific assessment rules based on combinations of these generic traces. This process aims to achieve a balance between the complexity and reusability of the approach, resulting in more scalable LA models for game-based learning. We also test this approach in two preliminary case studies where we explore the use of these techniques to cover different forms of assessment.}

This paper presents the findings of a study that looked at the impact of a learning analytics (LA)-based feedback system on students' self-regulated learning and academic achievement in a large, first-year undergraduate course. Using the COPES model of self-regulated learning (SRL), we analysed the learning operations of students, by way of log data from the learning management system and e-book, as well as the products of SRL, namely, performance on course assessments, from three years of course offerings. The latest course offering involved an intervention condition that made use of an educational technology to provide LA-based process feedback. Propensity score matching was employed to match a control group to the student cohort enrolled in the latest course offering, creating two equal-sized groups of students who received the feedback (the experimental group) and those who did not (the control group). Growth mixture modelling and mixed between-within ANOVA were also employed to identify differences in the patterns of online self-regulated learning operations over the course of the semester. The results showed that the experimental group showed significantly different patterns in their learning operations and performed better in terms of final grades. Moreover, there was no difference in the effect of feedback on final grades among students with different prior academic achievement scores, indicating that the LA-based feedback deployed in this course is able to support students’ learning, regardless of prior academic standing.}

However, leveraging this complex, multimodal data requires advanced analytical methods. While Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA) offers promise for exploring this data, the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance MMLA remains largely unexplored. This paper bridges these two evolving domains by conducting the first systematic literature review at the intersection of AI and MMLA, analyzing 43 peer-reviewed papers from 11 reputable databases published between 2019 and 2024. The findings indicate a growing trend in AI-enhanced MMLA studies published predominantly in high-quality venues, led by education researchers with a predominant focus on tertiary education targeting diverse stakeholders. Guided by a novel conceptual framework, our analysis highlights the transformative role of AI across the MMLA process, particularly in model learning and feature engineering. However, it also uncovers significant gaps, including limited AI implementation in components requiring deep integration with learning theories, insufficient application of advanced AI techniques, and lack of large-scale studies in authentic learning environments. The review identifies key benefits, such as enhanced personalization and real-time feedback, while also addressing challenges related to ethical considerations, data integration, and scalability. Our study contributes by offering comprehensive recommendations for future research, emphasizing international collaboration, multi-level studies, and ethical AI implementation. These findings advance the theoretical understanding of AI's role in education, providing a foundation for developing sophisticated, interpretable, and scalable AI-enhanced MMLA approaches, potentially revolutionizing personalized learning across diverse educational settings.}

abstract = {Recent developments in educational technology research underscores the importance of individuals and groups to regulate their own learning processes and behaviours to cope with the fast-changing world around them. This led many researchers to focus on the concept of Socially-Shared Regulation of Learning (SSRL) which tries to understand the different types of collective regulatory processes that emerge while learning in groups. Although initial investigations have predominantly theorised these phenomena, there is a growing need to operationalise SSRL to prepare learners for a future in which regulation of their learning is a key skill for success. This necessitates systematic examination of how Learning Design (LD) and Learning Analytics (LA) can be leveraged to promote, detect, and support SSRL. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic literature review of 110 empirical studies with the aim of identifying: (i) what does empirical literature consider as SSRL; (ii) how is LD used to promote SSRL; (iii) how are LA and LD used to detect SSRL; and (iv) how are LD and LA used to support SSRL. The findings from the literature indicate three major challenges to the operationalisation of SSRL support in the real-world: (i) the lack of convergence in theoretical models, together with the lack of validated instruments for detecting (e.g., coding schemes) and measuring (e.g., questionnaires) SSRL processes; (ii) the types of data most frequently collected and the analysis techniques used make it difficult to provide SSRL support to the students during the learning situations; and (iii) there is a lack of tools designed to promote, detect, and support SSRL processes. This paper describes each challenge, and provides a discussion about potential future research opportunities for tackling them.}

This paper contributes a detailed analysis of interviews with educators who introduced an automated writing feedback tool in their classrooms (triangulated with student and tutor survey data), over the course of a three-year collaboration with researchers, spanning six semesters' teaching. It explains educators' motivations, implementation strategies, outcomes, and challenges when using LA in authentic practice. The paper foregrounds the views of educators to support cross-fertilization between LA research and practice, and discusses the importance of cultivating educators' and students' agency when introducing novel, student-facing LA tools.}

Three hundred and fifty video-learning records from 47,044 video viewing operations were obtained from 47 graduate students. Four learning improvement profiles were derived from a statistics course's pre- and post-test scores: the Advanced, the Diligent, the Indifferent, and the Persistent. The results indicated that the Diligent and the Persistent paused videos frequently. These students reflected the need with these self-paced breaks to take notes according to the retrospective interview. The Advanced demonstrated the highest SkippingBackward frequency with a small SkippingBackward time ratio, revealing confidence in searching the desired clips. In contrast, the Indifferent exhibited the least frequency but the largest time ratio for SkippingBackward, implying distraction problems. In addition, this study showed that the Pause time ratio was indirectly related to weekly quiz scores via autonomous motivation with marginal significance. Based on these results, we demonstrate that learning motivation can be revealed from dynamic clickstreams in video-based learning (i.e., the interaction between students and learning contexts), supporting its dynamic developmental mechanism. The authors suggest that instructors offer on-demand instructional materials and implement top-down video-viewing strategies or digital prompts to support and encourage autonomy in video-based learning.}

Providing actionable feedback with LA for students is an emerging area of research. Previous studies have commonly focused on course-level aspects of supporting engagement with LA, but students' perspectives have received limited attention. This study analyzed pre-service teachers’ needs and expectations for LA to support student engagement on the academic path level, which means observing the continuum of study periods and academic years. Qualitative content analysis was conducted for video-recorded student small-group conversations to analyze in-depth how pre-service teachers (N = 40) described their needs for support student engagement and expectations and ethical concerns for using LA tools. Students suggested that LA tools could support their engagement by mediating information between the student and institution, facilitating effective studying, increasing awareness about themselves as learners, providing help and support in different challenging situations, and working as a feedback channel to adapt the learning conditions according to their individual needs. The results of this study demonstrate how student needs are sometimes contradictory, for example when students suggest more possibilities for agentic choices on their studies, but similarly more institutional monitoring or their study progression. This offers insights to clarify specific objectives for supporting student engagement with LA.}

Developing effective privacy-enhancing practices requires a systematic understanding of students’ privacy concerns and how they vary across national and cultural dimensions. We conducted a survey study with established instruments to measure privacy concerns and cultural values for university students in five countries (Germany, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United States; N = 762). The results show that students generally trusted institutions with their data and disclosed information as they perceived the risks to be manageable even though they felt somewhat limited in their ability to control their privacy. Across the five countries, German and Swedish students stood out as the most trusting and least concerned, especially compared to US students who reported greater perceived risk and less control. Students in South Korea and Spain responded similarly on all five privacy dimensions (perceived privacy risk, perceived privacy control, privacy concerns, trusting beliefs, and non-self-disclosure behavior), despite their significant cultural differences. Culture measured at the individual level affected the antecedents and outcomes of privacy concerns. Perceived privacy risk and privacy control increase with power distance. Trusting beliefs increase with a desire for uncertainty avoidance and lower masculinity. Non-self-disclosure behaviors rise with power distance and masculinity and decrease with more uncertainty avoidance. Thus, cultural values related to trust in institutions, social equality and risk-taking should be considered when developing privacy-enhancing practices and policies in higher education.}

In this context, mobile learning has got much momentum and is exemplified by diverse characteristics associated with the technologies and devices used, the enormous size of data generated throughout a learning session, and the interactions among the learners that occur outside the classroom. Consequently, sophisticated data analysis techniques are required to handle the intricacy of mobile learning and analyze the vast amount of datasets to enhance the learning experiences of mobile learners. This has led to the adoption of big data analytics for efficient processing of big learning data to add value to the mobile learning environments. Yet limited processing capability of the mobile devices is another key challenge faced by such big data analytics in mobile learning environments. To overcome this limitation, certain heavy computational parts could be offloaded to the cloud which can provide enough computation and storage resources. To this end, this paper presents a cloud based mobile learning framework that utilizes big data analytics technique to extract values from huge volume of mobile learners' data. Finally, we investigate learners' readiness and driving factors of mobile learning adoption in higher education institutions. In particular, we propose a hypothesized model for mobile learning adoption built on a locally extended technology acceptance model (TAM).}

In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on – i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist).

This paper presents the use of learning analytics for assessing individual contributions in a team project. The core of this framework is Moodle, a Learning Management System (LMS), that has the ability of monitoring and recording all the actions generated by students. It includes several Learning Analytics plugins, which help analyze and visualize the data collected. Based on these activities and event logs and interactions, the individual work and performance in a project is identified, which helps the teacher make a fair evaluation of the student. Students are grouped into teams with every team working on a course project. The experimental results presented in this paper have shown that it is possible to assess individual students in a team with a fair amount of accuracy.}

Collaborating groups of students may encounter problems concerning cognitive activities (such as a misunderstanding of the task material). If these problems are not addressed and resolved in time, the collaborative process is hindered. The teacher plays an important role in monitoring and solving the occurrence of problems. To provide adaptive support, teachers continuously have to be aware of students' activities in order to identify relevant events, including those that require intervention. Because the amount of available information is high, teachers may be supported by learning analytics. The present experimental study (n = 40) explored the effect of two learning analytics tools (the Concept Trail and Progress Statistics) that give information about students' cognitive activities. The results showed that when teachers had access to learning analytics, they were not better at detecting problematic groups, but they did offer more support in general, and more specifically targeted groups that experienced problems. This could indicate that learning analytics increase teachers' confidence to act, which in turn means students could benefit more from the teacher's presence.}

In this study, the effect of the student-facing learning analytics dashboard (LAD) on the learning behavior of students in the online learning environment was investigated by using the differential pattern mining method. In a completely remote course, the learning behaviors of the participants before the introduction of the dashboard were compared with the learning behaviors they exhibited after the dashboard was introduced. In this way, it has become possible to analyze the behavior changes after the dashboard intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether these behavioral changes were statistically significant or not. According to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results, while there is no significant difference in terms of students’ assignment and quiz interactions, it is seen that there is a statistically significant increase in terms of students’ forum-related activities such as reading other students’ posts, starting a new discussion, and replying others’ posts. Students’ SCORM interactions (e.g, launch, complete) were also increased after engaging with the LAD. In addition, it was found that the overall interaction of students in the online learning environment increased by 57% when the LAD was used.}

Based on a series of consultations with senior managers from 83 different higher education institutions in 24 European countries, we observe that LA is primarily perceived as a tool to enhance teaching and institutional management. As a result, teaching and support staff are found to be the main users of LA and the target audience of training support. In contrast, there is little evidence of active engagement with students or using LA to develop self-regulated learning skills.

The quasi-experimental study employed a mixed-method approach and spanned two months (N = 348). In the experimental condition, teachers provide specific LA information to students and adjust face-to-face instruction accordingly, while the control group does not receive these adaptations. The findings show that students are generally satisfied with the adapted learning environment, recognizing the value of teachers' LA-based adaptations. Results regarding students' basic psychological needs vary depending on the face-to-face workshop subject. This study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting how teachers' LA-based adaptations positively influence students' satisfaction with the learning environment, fulfilling their psychological needs. It underscores the significance of thoughtful BLE course design and provides recommendations for effective LA utilization in university settings. Based on the findings, several recommendations emerge. Data collection should prioritize group-level anonymity to ensure privacy. Digital learning platforms should provide clear and concise data visualizations to facilitate effective communication between teachers and students. Teachers should leverage LA insights to adapt face-to-face activities in the BLE. Clear guidance should be available to support teachers in utilizing LA effectively.}

This study is based on the analysis of 252 papers on learning analytics in higher education published between 2012 and 2018. The main research question is: What is the current scientific knowledge about the application of learning analytics in higher education? The focus is on research approaches, methods and the evidence for learning analytics. The evidence was examined in relation to four earlier validated propositions: whether learning analytics i) improve learning outcomes, ii) support learning and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) are used ethically. The results demonstrate that overall there is little evidence that shows improvements in students' learning outcomes (9%) as well as learning support and teaching (35%). Similarly, little evidence was found for the third (6%) and the forth (18%) proposition. Despite the fact that the identified potential for improving learner practice is high, we cannot currently see much transfer of the suggested potential into higher educational practice over the years. However, the analysis of the existing evidence for learning analytics indicates that there is a shift towards a deeper understanding of students’ learning experiences for the last years.}

Combining them with Game Learning Analytics can further improve the life-cycle of serious games, by informing decisions that shorten development time and reduce development iterations while improving their impact, therefore fostering their adoption. Game Learning Analytics is an evidence-based methodology based on in-game user interaction data, and can provide insight about the game-based educational experience promoting aspects such as a better assessment of the learning process. In this article, we review our experiences and results applying Game Learning Analytics for serious games in three different scenarios: (1) validating and deploying a game to raise awareness about cyberbullying, (2) validating the design of a game to improve independent living of users with intellectual disabilities and (3) improving the evaluation of a game on first aid techniques. These experiences show different uses of game learning analytics in the context of serious games to improve their design, evaluation and deployment processes. Building up from these experiences, we discuss the results obtained and provide lessons learnt from these different applications, to provide an approach that can be generalized to improve the design and application of a wide range of serious games in different educational settings.}

The accuracy, and related errors, of these systems can negatively influence their adoption. However, little effort has been made to investigate the errors made by the underlying models. This study focused on errors of models predicting students at risk of not submitting their assignments. We analysed two groups of error when the model was confident about the prediction: (a) students predicted to submit their assignment, yet they did not (False Negative; FN), and (b) students predicted not to submit their assignment yet they did (False Positive; FP). We followed the principles of thematic analysis to analyse interview data from 27 students whose predictions presented FN or FP errors. Findings revealed the significance of unexpected events occurring during studies that can affect students' behaviour and cannot be foreseen and accounted for in PLA, such as changes in family and work responsibilities, unexpected health issues and computer problems. Interview data helped identify new data sources, which could be integrated into predictions to mitigate some of the errors, such as study loan application information. Some other sources, e.g. capturing student knowledge at the start of the course, would require changes in the learning design of courses. Our insights showcase the importance of complimenting AI-based systems with human intelligence. In our case, these were both the interviewed students providing insights, as well potential users of these systems, e.g. teachers, who are aware of contextual factors, invisible to ML algorithms. We discuss the implications for improving predictions, learning design and teacher training in using PLA in their practice.}

Therefore, LATs must be adopted in higher learning institutions, but several factors hinder its implementation, primarily due to the lack of an implementation model. Therefore, in this study, the focus is directed towards examining LATs adoption in Higher Learning Institutions (HLIs), with emphasis on the determinants of the adoption process. The study mainly aims to design a model of LAT adoption and use it in the above context to improve the institutions' decision-making and accordingly, the study adopted an extended version of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the underpinning theory. Five experts validated the employed survey instrument, and 500 questionnaire copies were distributed through e-mails, from which 275 copies were retrieved from Saudi employees working at public HLIs. Data gathered was exposed to Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) for analysis and to test the proposed conceptual model. Based on the findings, the perceived usefulness of LAT plays a significant role as a determinant of its adoption. Other variables include top management support, financial support, and the government's role in LATs acceptance and adoption among HLIs. The findings also supported the contribution of LAT adoption and acceptance towards making informed decisions and highlighted the need for big data facility and cloud computing ability towards LATs usefulness. The findings have significant implications towards LATs implementation success among HLIs, providing clear insights into the factors that can enhance its adoption and acceptance. They also lay the basis for future studies in the area to validate further the effect of LATs on decision-making among HLIs institutions. Furthermore, the obtained findings are expected to serve as practical implications for policy makers and educational leaders in their objective to implement LAT using a multi-layered method that considers other aspects in addition to the perceptions of the individual user.}

This semester-long experiment was implemented in two instances of the course offering (Fall/2019 and Spring/2020) and involved a total of 146 students. The results showed that task-value scaffolding had a negative impact on learners’ computation anxiety and attitudes towards statistics in comparison to the control group. On the other hand, the treatment had no significant influence on other aspects of statistics anxiety, motivation, and learning outcomes. Taken jointly, these results suggest that the use of task-value scaffolding embedded in LADs can have detrimental effects on learners. More experimental studies are necessary to understand the positive and negative effects of LADs with motivational scaffolding.}

However, few studies attempt to understand how instructors interact with an LA dashboard and how self-regulated learning (SRL) activities and emotions of instructors occur and co-occur in the interaction. The current study investigates ten instructors’ SRL activities and epistemic emotions by analyzing the screen capture videos and think-aloud data while they interact with an LA dashboard designed to support the online asynchronous collaboration of multiple groups. The results reveal that instructors demonstrated two ways of navigating LA dashboards, and they relied heavily on the conversation explorer feature. Instructors were mostly engaged in elaboration, monitoring, and evaluation activities and they frequently experienced confusion and enjoyment. Expert instructors were more likely to refer to their personal teaching experience and demonstrated more epistemic emotions than novice instructors. This study contributes to the literature on SRL and teacher emotions by revealing the critical role of elaboration, monitoring, evaluation, and epistemic emotions when instructors attempt to understand a LA dashboard by themselves. These findings highlight the importance of providing pedagogical assistance to teachers who are trying to navigate between group dynamics and visualizations viewed using LA dashboards.}

Yet many students experienced difficulties in comprehending complex VLA due to their limited data visualisation literacy. While conventional scaffolding approaches like data storytelling have shown effectiveness in enhancing students’ comprehension of VLA, these approaches remain difficult to scale and adapt to individual learning needs. Generative AI (GenAI) technologies, especially conversational agents, offer potential solutions by providing personalised and dynamic support to enhance students’ comprehension of VLA. This controlled lab study investigates the effectiveness of GenAI agents, particularly when integrated with scaffolding techniques, in improving students’ comprehension of VLA. A randomised controlled trial was conducted with 117 higher education students to compare the effects of two types of GenAI agents: passive agents, which respond to student queries, and proactive agents, which utilise scaffolding questions, against standalone scaffolding in a VLA comprehension task. The results show that passive agents yield comparable improvements to standalone scaffolding both during and after the intervention. Notably, proactive GenAI agents significantly enhance students’ VLA comprehension compared to both passive agents and standalone scaffolding, with these benefits persisting beyond the intervention. These findings suggest that integrating GenAI agents with scaffolding can have lasting positive effects on students’ comprehension skills and support genuine learning.}

However, the development of educational games is very complex, essentially because of its multidisciplinary aspect. Fully integrating assessment is challenging and the games created are too often distributed as blackboxes; unmodifiable by the teachers and not providing much insight about the gameplays. We propose an assessment engine, EngAGe, to overcome these issues. EngAGe is used by both developers and educators. It is designed to separate game and assessment. Developers use it to easily integrate assessment into educational games and teachers can then modify the assessment and visualise learning analytics via an online interface. This paper focuses on EngAGe’s benefits for games developers. It presents a quantitative evaluation carried out with 36 developers (7 experienced and 29 students). Findings were very positive: every feature of the engine was rated useful and EngAGe received a usability score of 64 using the System Usability Scale. A Mann-Whitney U test showed a significant difference in usability (Z = −3.34, p < 0.002) between novice developers (mean = 56) and experienced developers (mean = 71) but none in terms of usefulness. This paper concludes that developers can use EngAGe effectively to integrate assessment and learning analytics in educational games.}

abstract = {Background
Surgeons need to train and certify their technical skills. This is usually done with the intervention of experts who monitor and assess trainees. Nevertheless, this is a time-consuming task that is subject to variations among evaluators. In recent decades, subjectivity has been significantly reduced through 1) the introduction of standard curricula, such as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) program, which measures students’ performance in specific exercises, and 2) rubrics, which are widely accepted in the literature and serve to provide feedback about the overall technical skills of the trainees. Although these two elements reduce subjectivity, they do not, however, eliminate the figure of the expert evaluator, and so the process remains time consuming.
Objectives
The objective of this work is to automate those parts of the work of the expert evaluator that the technology can measure objectively, using sensors to collect evidence, and visualizations to provide feedback. We designed and developed 1) a cost-effective IoT (Internet of Things) learning environment for the training and assessment of surgical technical skills and 2) visualizations supported by the literature on visual learning analytics (VLA) to provide feedback about the exercises (in real time) and overall performance (at the end of the training) of the trainee.
Methods
A hybrid approach was followed based on previous research for the design of the sensor based IoT learning environment. Previous studies were used as the basis for getting best practices on the tracking of surgical instruments and on the detection of the force applied to the tissue, with a focus on reducing the costs of data collection. The monitoring of the specific exercises required the design of sensors and collection mechanisms from scratch as there is little existing research on this subject. Moreover, it was necessary to design the overall architecture to collect, process, synchronize and communicate the data coming from the different sensors to provide high-level information relevant to the end user. The information to be presented was already validated by the literature and the focus was on how to visualize this information and the optimal time for its presentation to end users. The visualizations were validated with 18 VLA experts assessing the technical aspects of the visualizations and 4 medical experts assessing their functional aspects.
Results
This IoT learning environment amplifies the evaluation mechanisms already validated by the literature, allowing automatic data collection. First, it uses IoT sensors to automatically correct two of the exercises defined in the FLS (peg transfer and precision cutting), providing real-time visualizations. Second it monitors the movement of the surgical instruments and the force applied to the tissues during the exercise, computing 6 of the high-level indicators used by expert evaluators in their rubrics (efficiency, economy of movement, hand tremor, depth perception, bimanual dexterity, and respect for tissue), providing feedback about the technical skills of the trainee using a radar chart with these six indicators at the end of the training (summative visualizations).
Conclusions
The proposed IoT learning environment is a promising and cost-effective alternative to help in the training and assessment of surgical technical skills. The system shows the trainees’ progress and presents new indicators about the correctness of each specific exercise through real-time visualizations, as well as their general technical skills through summative visualizations, aligned with the 6 more frequent indicators in standardized scales. Early results suggest that although both types of visualizations are useful, it is necessary to reduce the cognitive load of the graphs presented in real time during training. Nevertheless, an additional evaluation is needed to confirm these results.}

abstract = {Clickstream data have been used increasingly to present students in online courses with analytics about their learning process to support self-regulation. Drawing on self-regulated learning theory and attribution theory, we hypothesize that providing students with analytics on their own effort along with the effort and performance of relevant peers will help students attribute their performance to factors under their control and thus positively influence their subsequent behavior and performance. To test the effect of the analytics and verify the proposed mechanism, we conducted an experiment in an online undergraduate course in which students were randomly assigned to receive theoretically inert questions (control condition), attribution questions (active control condition), and the analytics with attribution questions (treatment condition). The intervention significantly increased effort attribution, reduced ability attribution, and improved subsequent effort for a subgroup of students who self-reported low performance, although there was no significant impact on their performance.}

One class with 26 students was assigned to the experimental group using the ITD-DFM to support learning, whereas the other class with 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional test system without diagnosis and feedback mechanisms (TTS-NDFM). Experimental results reveal that the learning performance, physics self-efficacy, and technology acceptance of the experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group. The ITD-DFM has the same effect on promoting the learning performance of learners with different prior knowledge levels as well as learners with either high or low prior knowledge level in the experimental group exhibited significant improvement in physics self-efficacy, but no such results in the control group. The ITD-DFM provides more benefit in promoting the technology acceptance of learners with high prior knowledge level.}

The setting includes a digitally rich environment, in which technologies simulate the fall of a ball on an inclined plane, and indicate measures of time and distance. The teacher has developed the professional habit of capitalizing on different semiotic resources (gestures, diagrams, pictures), in her teaching. We use the Scheme for Educational Dialog Analysis (SEDA) (Hennessy et al., 2016) to suggest that the dialog is productive in terms of the advancement of instrumental covariation. To show the how of this productivity, we analyze patterns of interaction to show that the teacher succeeds in adapting her moves to the needs of the students through multimodal communication (oral, gestural, pictorial [referring to pictures/diagrams in an oral or gestural mode]). We show that the teacher facilitates meaning making among several groups working in parallel, and by such, we provide a proof-of-existence of adaptive instruction as a type of orchestration through the participation to semiotic games.}

However, students often have poor self-regulation practices, lack reflective thinking, and fail to monitor their learning against defined goals. Therefore, a variety of advanced learning technologies and features have been developed to support students with regulation. Nevertheless, the optimal level of regulation support and the most effective combination of these features remain unestablished in the existing research literature. Therefore, this study employs quantitative research to examine the effectiveness of two learning environments with different levels of self-regulation support (less and more) on students' learning academic outcomes, learning process, and satisfaction. Both variants combine the elements of learning dashboards, goal-setting activity, self-assessment task, reflection support, and personal recommendation, with differences in the level of supporting students' regulation. Our findings reveal that students who received higher levels of self-regulation support tended to be more active readers and visited online learning materials and course overviews more frequently. While they outperformed students in the control group, it's noteworthy that these students did not necessarily outperform their peers who received less support, particularly in the context of self-assessment tasks. This study has also highlighted the need for further research in this area (e.g., self-assessment accuracy), including the development of an instrument that can objectively measure and evaluate the level of self-regulated learning support.}

abstract = {Background
Short instructional videos can make learning more efficient through the application of multimedia principles, and video animations can illustrate the complex concepts and dynamic processes that are common in health sciences education. Commercially produced videos are commonly used by medical students but are rarely integrated into curricula.
Objective
Our goal was to examine student engagement with medical education videos incorporated into a preclinical Cardiovascular Systems course.
Methods
Students who took the first-year 8-week Cardiovascular Systems course in 2019 and 2020 were included in the study. Videos from Osmosis were recommended to be watched before live sessions throughout the course. Video use was monitored through dashboards, and course credit was given for watching videos. All students were emailed electronic surveys after the final exam asking about the course’s blended learning experience and use of videos. Osmosis usage data for number of video views, multiple choice questions, and flashcards were extracted from Osmosis dashboards.
Results
Overall, 232/359 (64.6%) students completed surveys, with rates by class of 81/154 (52.6%) for MD Class of 2022, 39/50 (78%) for MD/MPH Class of 2022, and 112/155 (72.3%) for MD Class of 2023. Osmosis dashboard data were available for all 359 students. All students received the full credit offered for Osmosis engagement, and learning analytics demonstrated regular usage of videos and other digital platform features. Survey responses indicated that most students found Osmosis videos to be helpful for learning (204/232, 87.9%; P=.001) and preferred Osmosis videos to the traditional lecture format (134/232, 57.8%; P<.001).
Conclusions
Commercial medical education videos may enhance curriculum with low faculty effort and improve students’ learning experiences. Findings from our experience at one medical school can guide the effective use of supplemental digital resources for learning, and related evaluation and research.}

The majority of related work in this field has been centered on batch gathering and analysis of the data. However, in order to integrate more reactive applications, there is a need for an infrastructure that enables the real-time collection and analysis of data in learning environments. Such an infrastructure should be scalable and flexible enough to cope with heterogeneous data coming from different types of learning settings. This paper presents Lostrego, a stream-based, modular, scalable and flexible distributed infrastructure that allows the gathering and analysis of educational data from heterogeneous data sources in a real-time fashion. Lostrego applications are composed by interconnected services that can be reused in different courses. The results of the evaluation of Lostrego in two editions of a computer programming course with 233 students and 384,702 gathered events are also reported.}

This paper presents a case study conducted at the Catholic University of Murcia, where student behavior in the past four academic years was analyzed according to learning modality (that is, on-campus, online, and blended), considering the number of accesses to the LMS, tools employed by students and their associated events. Given the difficulty of managing the large volume of data generated by users in the LMS (up to 70 GB in this study), statistical and association rule techniques were performed using a Big Data framework, thus speeding up the statistical analysis of the data. The obtained results are demonstrated using visual analytic techniques, and evaluated in order to detect trends and deficiencies in the use of the LMS by students.}

It is reported that such problems can be eliminated by making the new generation intelligent learning systems. However, there is still an ongoing search for making such systems intelligent and a conceptual discussion concerning them. Integrating an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with learning analytics, this study seeks to design and present the framework of an ITS with open access that a) identifies the learning needs of learners through adaptive mastery testing and guides learners based on these needs, b) overcomes learning deficiencies, monitors learners' interactions with content through learning analytics and offers suggestions, c) supports learning with dynamic assessment processes and d) tests learners’ learning competencies. This article aims to explain the conceptual and system framework for the design of an adaptive, dynamic, intelligent tutoring system (SMIT), supported by learning analytics, which is a product of the project, which aims to integrate LMS and ITS, on the idea of how to make systems such as MOOCs smarter.

However, research has found that learners often struggle to adapt their behaviour to the self-regulatory demands of DLEs. Furthermore, existing SRL analysis tools have limited utility for real-time or individualized prescriptive support of a learner's SRL strategy during a study session. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach using reinforcement learning as a framework to optimize the sequence of SRL processes for a learning task. This framework allows us to model and optimize the SRL strategy as a sequential decision-making problem, where each decision corresponds to an SRL process. The goal is to find an optimal sequence of decisions that maximizes performance in learning outcomes such as assessment score or learning gains. We compare the performance of our reinforcement learning framework with other sequential machine learning tools, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The results of our study show that our reinforcement learning model outperforms GA and LSTM models in optimizing SRL strategy. The contributions of this work can facilitate the development of a tool which can detect sub-optimal SRL strategy in real-time and enable individualized SRL focused scaffolding.}

abstract = {Background
Higher educational institutions strive to recruit and retain student nurses into pre-registration programmes to support a sustainable nursing workforce. Attrition rates for student nurses are high and escalating, with around one in three nursing students in the United Kingdom failing to complete their degree programmes. Risk factors for student attrition include the attributes students bring to their study environment, as well as their behaviours and academic outputs. Modern learning analytics engagement tool can monitor attrition risk through tracking students as they engage with learning resources and other institutional opportunities.
Aim
To evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention package aimed at reducing pre-registration nursing student attrition rates at a Higher Education Institute in South East England.
Design and methods
Our mixed methods study design had three phases. Phase 1: design of an intervention package and its planned implementation. Phase 2: piloted the intervention with 1198 student nurses. Phase 3: semi-structured interviews with five student nurses.
Results
The learning analytics engagement tool was able to identify 144 students who were struggling and/or disengaging with their academic studies. 17 % (n = 24) students responding to the initial email contact. Of these 24 students, 67 % (n = 16) did not want a meeting with the Intervention Officer, who they were unfamiliar with, and only one attended a meeting.
Conclusion
Our evaluation of the effectiveness of an intervention package in reducing pre-registration nursing student attrition rates revealed valuable insights. Findings revealed that a lack of trusting relationships with intervention facilitators is likely to diminish engagement with such interventions.}

We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.}

abstract = {Source code plagiarism is a significant issue in educational practice, and educators need user-friendly tools to cope with such academic dishonesty. This article introduces the latest version of Dolos, a state-of-the-art ecosystem of tools for detecting and preventing plagiarism in educational source code. In this new version, the primary focus has been on enhancing the user experience. Educators can now run the entire plagiarism detection pipeline from a new web app in their browser, eliminating the need for any installation or configuration. Completely redesigned analytics dashboards provide an instant assessment of whether a collection of source files contains suspected cases of plagiarism and how widespread plagiarism is within the collection. The dashboards support hierarchically structured navigation to facilitate zooming in and out of suspect cases. Clusters are an essential new component of the dashboard design, reflecting the observation that plagiarism can occur among larger groups of students. To meet various user needs, the Dolos software stack for source code plagiarism detection now includes a self-hostable web app, a JSON application programming interface (API), a command line interface (CLI), a JavaScript library and a preconfigured Docker container. Clear documentation and a free-to-use instance of the web app can be found at https://dolos.ugent.be. The source code is also available on GitHub.}

abstract = {Prediction of students’ academic performance has garnered considerable interest, with many institutions seek to enhance students’ performance and their quality of education. The integration of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques has demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting student performance. This paper explores the application of different machine learning methods in predicting student academic performance. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilised to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, thereby improving its visualisation. Subsequently, K-Means clustering was employed to segregate students into distinct groups, reflective of their learning behaviors. Afterwards, the observed clusters were utilised for training classification models to address each student cluster individually. This approach was implemented in a case study involving an undergraduate science course at a North American University (NAU) and the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). Empirical findings indicate that the combined use of Feedforward Dense Network (FDN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), specifically in their clustered forms, outperforms other classifiers in predicting student academic performance effectively.}

This paper presents our approach on how the usage of VLEs (Virtual Learning Environments) can be traced and used to enhance the teaching quality so as to improve engagement. We focus our work on secondary education. The question is not to predict the performance of students, from the collected data, which is always controversial; or just define a set of pre-established metrics, obtained from the digital data contained into the VLE, and monitor them, indirectly inducing an assessment regime. The aim is to look beyond the traces left by students and to measure the motivation of a student in a particular task, of a given subject, and in a specific day. For this purpose, we rely on the psychometric theory of measurement to build a composite index of motivation and we embed it into a Learning Analytics system. The ultimate goal of this system is to provide teachers and stakeholders with objective and accurate (quasi) real time information about students’ motivation for learning, and hence adequately adapt and personalize the teaching methodologies and strategies in classrooms. The approach is general and can also be used in tertiary education for training students and researchers in High Performance and Data Intensive Computing.}

It is possible to collect and analyze learning logs even in classes with many learners, including clickstreams and quiz scores in detail for each individual. This research proposes using Moodle's learning logs to classify learning patterns and outliers in order to identify struggling learners. The proposed method uses the descriptive statistics between the learner's teaching material clickstream and the final test score accumulated in Moodle, and students can be classified into four learning patterns. The frequency of each learning pattern was correlated with the appearance of outliers in the final test score and the teaching material clickstream. Most learners moved through four learning patterns during the weekly lessons, however, some learners scoring at the top and bottom of the weekly quiz scores repeated the same learning patterns. There was a tendency to correspond to an outlier due to the repetition of the same learning pattern. The time-series learning analytics of the teaching material clickstream revealed that learners with low final test scores and abnormal values tended to fall under a learning pattern with a smaller teaching material clickstream and a smaller access outside class hours.}

We therefore adapted a digital learning environment and rule-based AI algorithm originally designed to measure SRL in higher education and collected multi-trace data from 13-year-old students (N = 179) across three European countries during an essay-writing task. Hidden Markov modeling was employed to capture latent SRL processes. Four latent SRL processes emerged: orientation, first-reading, writing, and re-reading combined with monitoring. By clustering sequences of these latent SRL processes, we identified four sequential patterns of SRL processes at the task level: writing with metacognitive monitoring, writing intensively, reading first, writing next, and reading and writing simultaneously. Our findings highlight how AI and multi-trace data can be used to measure SRL during learning, providing a basis for enhancing personalized support.
Educational relevance and implications statement
Self-regulated learning (SRL) is vital in the digital world. In this study, we investigated secondary education students' SRL processes with digital trace data. We also demonstrated that the instrumentation of a digital learning environment and rule-based AI algorithm originally designed to measure SRL processes in higher education can be leveraged to measure SRL processes in secondary education students. The real-time measurement of covert SRL processes is important as this information can 1) raise students' awareness on their learning, 2) help teachers to support students' learning, and 3) form the basis for providing personalized support for these processes with the help of AI-enhanced learning technologies.}

Three alternative measures were designed to determine numerical values for each dimension, according to their capacity to predict academic performance in terms of final grades, using regression analysis. According to the study’s findings, the logical/mathematical dimension plays an important role in student performance, while anxiety has a negative effect on final grades.

Socio-affective relationships play an important role in learning processes and learning outcomes, but they are harder to develop in online-learning. This can be explained by a lack of emotion awareness due to the asynchronous interactions, technical challenges, and tutors’ focus on properly conducting the learning activity and gearing towards pedagogical outcomes. We conducted an eight-week long field study with five professional tutors on how they used Emodash while writing feedback to learners after language learning sessions. We found that Emodash led tutors who were already sensitive to learners’ emotions to incorporate more affective elements in their reports, suggesting a stronger awareness of learners’ emotions. Tutors also wrote more formative and less summative feedback. Furthermore, our results suggest that glanceable visualizations of learners’ emotions may be preferred and sufficient to foster tutors’ awareness of learners’ emotions. Finally, the dashboard led tutors to reflect on the way they conduct their lessons, using learners’ positive emotions as a proxy evaluation of their teaching.}

This may be since the implementation of LA in national or regional scope and using data from governments and institutions poses many challenges that may threaten the success of such initiatives, including the same availability of data. The present article describes the experience of LA in Latin America using governmental data from Elementary and Middle Schools of the State of Norte de Santander - Colombia. This study is focusing on students' performance. Data from 2013 to 2018 was collected, containing information related to 1) students’ enrollment in school disciplines provided by Regional Education Secretary, 2) students qualifications provided by educational institutions, and 3) students qualifications provided by the national agency for education evaluation. The methodology followed includes a process of cleaning and integration of the data, subsequently a descriptive and visualization analysis is made and some educational data mining techniques are used (decision trees and clustering) for the modeling and extraction of some educational patterns. A total of eight patterns of interest are extracted. In addition to the decision trees, a feature ranking analysis was performed using xgboost and to facilitate the visual representation of the clusters, t-SNE and self-organized maps (SOM) were applied as result projection techniques. Finally, this paper compares the main challenges mentioned by the literature according to the Colombian experience and proposes an up-to-date list of challenges and solutions that can be used as a baseline for future works in this area and aligned with the Latin American context and reality.}

We seek to understand how community awareness facilitates the learning design activity of teachers in different educational contexts. Following a design-based research methodology, we developed a community awareness dashboard (inILDE) based on the Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) framework. The dashboard displays the activity of teachers in ILDE, such as their interactions with learning designs, other members, and with supporting learning design tools. Evaluations of the inILDE dashboard were carried out in four educational communities – two secondary schools, a master programme for pre-service teachers, and in a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for teachers. The dashboard was perceived to be useful in summarizing the activity of the community and in identifying content and members' roles. Further, the use of the dashboard increased participants' interactions such as profile views and teachers showed a willingness to build on the contributions of others. As conclusions of the study, we propose five design principles for supporting awareness in learning design communities, namely community context, practice-related insights, visualizations and representations, tasks and community interests.}

This study investigates how digital transformation changes the instructional design and implementation of large-scale blended learning programs for better learner experiences. It emphasizes the significance of diverse stakeholders' engagement in institution-initiated blended programs to promote effective online professional development. Utilizing Research-Practice Partnerships (RPPs), this study adopts a case study approach, employing participatory observation, interviews, log data, and online discourses to analyze how interactions across various sectors and levels affect the transformation to blended programs and the professional development of the involved instructors. The findings reveal that the institution-initiated blended learning approach, resembling an apprenticeship model, effectively integrates teaching practice with online professional development. An in-depth analysis of two university courses shows that key events and task-oriented approaches significantly influence instructors' online engagement, enhancing their digital literacy. Teacher Handbooks, driven by real learner data, guide teaching practices effectively, while collaborative research meetings greatly enhance the use of data analytics in teaching. Although this top-down approach presents challenges, this study demonstrates that instructors can innovatively tackle these issues. Institutional support is more likely to foster collaborative learning communities across various sectors and hierarchies. This study contributes to the field by introducing a pioneering framework in the institution's innovative educational reform, creating online professional development communities for faculty members of all ages, and enabling them to quickly and easily adapt to the digital transformation of higher education.}

While the field remains productive and diverse, recent trends reflect a growing emphasis on integrating emerging technologies such as learning analytics, augmented and virtual reality, and artificial intelligence (AI) into collaborative learning contexts. The study uncovers a tension within CSCL between its epistemological and methodological diversity and the need for theoretical coherence. This diversity has allowed the field to adapt and innovate but raises concerns about fragmentation and the risk of losing a unified identity. For example, while scripting remains a foundational topic, debates persist on balancing instructional guidance with learner agency to foster productive collaboration.

abstract = {This case study challenges the assumption that successful game-based learning requires flow experience. Analyses of player logs of gameplay behavior and self-reports of subjective experience, establish that challenge often exceeds skill during the type of inquiry-based learning that occurs when instructional games scaffold player discovery and application of targeted concepts. This pattern persists when integrated game dashboards allow players to define and achieve expertise. The analysis here follows three players during their trajectories toward expertise development, while playing the online instructional video game Selene: A Lunar Construction GaME: participants were an undergraduate female (USA Midwest university) and two Spanish teenagers (non-USA, one female and one male, 15-years of age). Theory and data suggest perceived experience during game-based learning (states, such as anxiety, worry, and arousal) might be conceptualized as eustress, which is known to accompany successful adaptation.}

abstract = {To address the demands of modern education and increase flexibility, many higher education institutions are considering self-paced education programs. However, student retention is yet a widely recognized challenge faced in self-paced education. While many studies have examined the potential of the use of data about student interaction with learning technologies to predict student success, studies that focus on self-paced education are scarce. To address this gap in the literature, this paper reports on the findings of a study that has investigated the performance of a well-known deep learning technique i.e., Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), in the prediction of students at risk of failing a course offered in a self-paced mode of online education. The study has utilized a freely accessible Open University Learning Analytics Dataset comprising 22,437 students with 69 % pass, and 31 % failed instances. The deep LSTM shows the highest predictive power to classify between pass and fail students, compared to all other alternatives by achieving an accuracy of 84.57 %, precision of 82.24 % and recall of 79.43 %. Interestingly, with only first five weeks of course activity log data used for training, the receiver operating characteristic based diagnostic accuracy of the LSTM algorithm is achieved up to 71 %, that outperforms almost all other conventional algorithms - despite trained on the complete dataset collected for the entire duration of the course i.e. up to 38 weeks. Furthermore, this study has also employed a shapely additive explanation model to identify the most important predictors of student retention, e.g., assessment submission and attempted quizzes. This approach is essential in order to increase the interpretability of deep learning techniques and, thus, increase their potential to generate actionable insights.}

abstract = {With the arrival of fine-grained log-data and the emergence of learning analytics, there may be new avenues to explore how Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) can provide a lens to how students learn in blended and online environments. In particular, recent research has found that the notion of time may be an essential but complex concept through which students make (un)conscious and self-regulated decisions as to when, what, and how to study. This study explores distinct clusters of behavioural engagement in an online e-tutorial called Sowiso at different time points (before tutorials, before quizzes, before exams), and their associations with academic performance, self-regulated learning strategies, epistemic learning emotions, and activity learning emotions. Using a cluster analysis on trace data of 1035 students practicing 429 online exercises in Sowiso, we identified four distinct cluster of students (e.g. early mastery, strategic, exam-driven, and inactive). Further analyses revealed significant differences between the four clusters in their academic performance, step-wise cognitive processing strategies, external self-regulation strategies, epistemic learning emotions and activity learning emotions. Our findings took a step forward towards personalised and actionable feedback in learning analytics by recognizing the complexity of how and when students engage in learning activities over time, and supporting educators to design early and theoretically informed interventions based on learning dispositions.}

This study deploys a deep artificial neural network on a set of unique handcrafted features, extracted from the virtual learning environments clickstream data, to predict at-risk students providing measures for early intervention of such cases. The results show the proposed model to achieve a classification accuracy of 84%–93%.

These logs offer the opportunity to provide dashboards and analysis on learners. There are several techniques that analyze event logs for different purposes (adaptation, recommendation, performance detection, etc.). Within this framework, our central focus is upon Educational Process Mining technique which generates process models for improving learning resource recommendation. We set forward an architecture leading to discover process models and recommend to the learner not only learning resource but also process models, each of which is relative to a specific learning resource. These models exert a certain influence on the result of learning resource recommendation. One of the reason that endows our work with an original aspect is that it automatically analyses event logs based on multi-features extracted from the learner’s profiles. However, the state of the art works require a manual analysis step based on learning results uniquely. We evaluated the discovered process models grounded on the event logs of Moodle LMS. These event logs contain 42,438 traces of 100 students who learned a course over one semester. Results corroborate the good performance of our work.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical reasoning is a fundamental process medical students have to learn during and after medical school. Virtual patients (VP) are a technology-enhanced learning method to teach clinical reasoning. However, VP systems do not exploit their full potential concerning the clinical reasoning process; for example, most systems focus on the outcome and less on the process of clinical reasoning.
Objectives
Keeping our concept grounded in a former qualitative study, we aimed to design and implement a tool to enhance VPs with activities and feedback, which specifically foster the acquisition of clinical reasoning skills.
Methods
We designed the tool by translating elements of a conceptual clinical reasoning learning framework into software requirements. The resulting clinical reasoning tool enables learners to build their patient’s illness script as a concept map when they are working on a VP scenario. The student’s map is compared with the experts’ reasoning at each stage of the VP, which is technically enabled by using Medical Subject Headings, which is a comprehensive controlled vocabulary published by the US National Library of Medicine. The tool is implemented using Web technologies, has an open architecture that enables its integration into various systems through an open application program interface, and is available under a Massachusetts Institute of Technology license.
Results
We conducted usability tests following a think-aloud protocol and a pilot field study with maps created by 64 medical students. The results show that learners interact with the tool but create less nodes and connections in the concept map than an expert. Further research and usability tests are required to analyze the reasons.
Conclusions
The presented tool is a versatile, systematically developed software component that specifically supports the clinical reasoning skills acquisition. It can be plugged into VP systems or used as stand-alone software in other teaching scenarios. The modular design allows an extension with new feedback mechanisms and learning analytics algorithms.}

The continuous proliferation of data nowadays has inspired companies to make data-informed decisions. Despite the acknowledged benefits of analytics, there is a persistent question about how companies, especially software startup companies with distinguishing characteristics, can effectively create value from it. In the startup context, analytics refers to the use of startup data and insights to inform strategies and tactics across startup business, product, team, sales, and marketing dimensions.
Objective:
In this study, we aim to bridge the knowledge gap by eliciting an understanding of the analytics that software startup companies hold and identifying critical challenges they face in the realm of analytics.
Method:
We conducted a multiple-case study with eight software startups at different startup stages. In addition to the data collected through semi-structured interviews, we considered other data sources such as analytics dashboards and online data about the startups, including websites and social media platforms. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis.
Results:
Our results firstly revealed a divergent understanding of analytics by software startups, based on which we reported essential characteristics of analytics perceived by them. Then we identified 22 analytics challenges classified into six main themes. The themes encompass data capture and access challenges, data interpretation and bias, communication challenges, cultural challenges, external influences and constraints, and analytics implementation challenges.
Conclusions:
Our findings contribute to a conceptual understanding of analytics in software startups and the identification of critical challenges faced by these startups across different stages. The conceptual understanding lays the foundation for comprehending what constitutes analytics for software startups, while the identification of challenges anticipates critical barriers to the adoption and implementation of analytics. We also provide practical implications to both researchers and practitioners.}

We found limited studies that investigate and characterize domain problems or design requirements of visual analytics for MOOC. This paper aims to present the empirical problem characterization and abstraction for visual analytics in MOOC learner's support monitoring. Detailed characterization and abstraction of the domain problem help visualization designer to derive design requirements in generating appropriate visualization solution. We examined the literature and conducted a case study to elicit a problem abstraction based on data, users, and tasks. We interviewed five Malaysian MOOC experts from three higher education institutes using semi-structured questions. Our case study reveals the priority of enabling MOOC analysis on learner's progression and course completion.

However, there is limited research investigating whether and how self-regulation leads to different learning outcomes among students in engineering design. This study analyzes the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade U.S. students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. It classifies the students into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. The results also offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning with emerging learning analytics.}

abstract = {Learning analysis consists of collecting the traces that learners leave behind and using these traces to enhance learning [1]. The Learning analytics use techniques from different fields such as Artificial intelligent, Machine learning, data mining, text mining and web analytic, etc. Moreover, individual learners intended methods to stimulate reflection on their achievements and their behavior in relation to others and for teachers and support staff to plan supportive interventions with individuals and groups. This article focuses on the exploration of analytical mechanisms that take into consideration learners’ personal characteristics specifically the level of preparation and previous knowledge, preferences, cultural features, demographic characteristics like age, gender, etc. in the feedback model.}

abstract = {Hybrid systems combining artificial and human intelligence hold great promise for training human skills. In this paper, I position the concept of Hybrid Human-AI Regulation and illustrate this with an example of a first prototype of a Hybrid Human-AI Regulation (HHAIR) system. HHAIR supports self-regulated learning (SRL) in the context of adaptive learning technologies (ALTs) with the aim to develop learners' self-regulated learning skills. This prototype targets young learners (10–14 years) for whom SRL skills are critical in today's society. Many of these learners use ALTs to learn mathematics and languages every day in school. ALTs optimize learning based on learners' performance data, but even the most sophisticated ALTs fail to support SRL. In fact, most ALTs take over (offload) regulation from learners. In contrast, HHAIR positions hybrid regulation as a collaborative task of the learner and the AI which is gradually transferred from AI-regulation to self-regulation. Learners will increasingly regulate their own learning progressing through different degrees of hybrid regulation. In this way HHAIR supports optimized learning and the transfer and development of SRL skills for lifelong learning (future learning). The HHAIR concept is novel in proposing a hybrid intelligence approach training human SRL skills with AI. This paper outlines theoretical foundations from SRL theory, hybrid intelligence and learning analytics. A first prototype in the context of ALTs for young learners is described as an example of hybrid human-AI regulation and future advancement is discussed. In this way, foundational theoretical, empirical, and design work are combined in articulating the concept of Hybrid Human-AI Regulation which features forward adaptive support for SRL and transfer of control between human and AI over regulation.}

abstract = {This research is crucial in the context of responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to Higher Education. Before implementing a Machine Learning (ML) model in a real environment, such as a university’s Learning Management System (LMS), training and testing it on a representative dataset is imperative. However, collecting such data can be both technically and legally complex, prompting many researchers and practitioners to use existing datasets. This approach has three major drawbacks: (a), the borrowed datasets are often collected for different use cases, making the assessment of model performance less reliable. (b), the descriptions of these datasets are often too succinct to enable a non-education specialist to determine their suitability for a specific use case, and (c) the availability of existing datasets does not guarantee that they have been collected ethically. To address these concerns, we carried out a Systematic Mapping Review (SMS), selecting 55 relevant articles from the IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, Springer Link, and Scopus databases. We reviewed and analyzed these articles describing various educational datasets used in academic research between 2022 and 2023. In addition, we proposed technical and ethical criteria to facilitate the selection of appropriate datasets for research and experimentation. Finally, we developed a new multidimensional taxonomy to characterize these datasets and to organize and structure their classification according to these criteria. Such a proposal would enable researchers and practitioners to better understand the nature and scope of available educational datasets, facilitating their selection for effective use in educational research and practice.}

These regions, mainly comprising low- and middle-income countries, often face challenges related to inadequate medical infrastructure and a lack of skilled personnel for accurately diagnosing febrile diseases. Distinguishing one febrile illness from another posed a significant challenge, adding to the complexity of accurate diagnoses. This study developed a multi-symptom multi-disease model to address this challenge, leveraging exploratory data analysis of patient datasets from field studies and the expertise of medical practitioners specializing in tropical diseases. The research investigated the most effective modeling approach for differentiating among 11 febrile illnesses that are prevalent in Nigeria using three intelligent techniques: Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Comparative analysis demonstrates that AHP surpassed the others, achieving a precision of 84%, recall of 83%, and an F1-score of 84%. Consequently, the AHP technique was integrated into the development of “Febra Diagnostica,” an app aimed at enhancing febrile disease diagnosis in resource-constrained settings. The app was then deployed and utilized in select Nigerian states, offering scalability and empowering frontline health workers in primary health facilities. Febra Diagnostica featured user-friendly interfaces, automated diagnosis and treatment suggestions, streamlined referrals, and provisions for further investigations. Encryption, access control, and multi-factor authentication were some of the security and privacy considerations in the app which gained acceptance from medical experts and adapted to regulatory and ethical policies for smart healthcare systems.}

This work reports on an investigation into these questions, which we answer through analyses exploring metrics, machine learning classifiers, and recommendations. We report on several findings: the degree of expertise correlates to behavioral patterns, whereby experts would rarely ask for help, and instead, predominantly provide help to other community members; the inclusion of an expert results in longer discussions. We propose a metric (the weighted sum), which enables us to better quantify the reputations of expert members of the community. We describe the use of four machine learning classifiers for the identification of both expert users and the most significant conversations within these communities. We propose a novel approach for a recommendation system, which utilizes semantic annotations to identify topical experts and to ascertain their respective area of specialism. We foresee the suitability of our expertise-finding methods and findings to support Learning Analytics, and in scenarios where users may apply lessons learnt from our results to improve their status in a community. Our findings can also inform systems for recommending experts and discussions.}

This study explores the effects of two well-established scaffolding strategies — scripting and self-monitoring on students’ engagement, quality of peer feedback, and evaluative judgement. A total of 149 higher education students from a course that utilises a peer feedback tool were randomly divided into two conditions: one leveraging an interface for peer feedback provision that incorporates scripted instruction and the other using an interface implemented to support self-monitoring. Results suggest a significant distinction between the two scaffolded strategies. Students in the scripted condition provided longer and superior-quality feedback and also exhibited a more critical perspective in their evaluations compared to the self-monitoring condition. This study unfolds two significant contributions. First, it enriches the growing body of empirical evidence on educational design principles in peer feedback provision by expanding our understanding of the individual scaffolding tool effects, specifically in the context of scripting and self-monitoring. This contribution is crucial as it lays the groundwork for more nuanced explorations into optimal strategies for their application in future research. Second, the study contributes to the burgeoning interest in developing theory-based digital learning environments. We discuss the implications of these findings, including highlighting potential long-term advantages associated with the employment of the self-monitoring approach despite its seemingly less effective performance in the short run.}

Our paper examines the potential and challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to code student-generated content in online discussions based on intended learning outcomes and how instructors could use this to assess the intended and enacted learning design. If instructors were to rely on LLMs as a means of assessment, the reliability of these models to code the data accurately is crucial. Employing a diverse set of LLMs from the GPT family and prompting techniques on an asynchronous online discussion dataset from a blended-learning bachelor-level course, our research examines the reliability of AI-supported coding in educational research. Findings reveal that while AI-supported coding demonstrates efficiency, achieving substantial, moderate agreement with human coding for specific nuanced and context-dependent codes is challenging. Moreover, the high cost, token limits, and the advanced necessary skills needed to write API scripts might limit the usability of AI-driven coding. Finally, implementation would require specific parameterization techniques based on the class and may not be feasible for widespread implementation. Our study underscores the importance of transparency in AI coding methodologies and the need for a hybrid approach that integrates human judgement to ensure data accuracy and interpretability. In addition, it contributes to the knowledge base about the reliability of LLMs to code real, small datasets using complex codes that are common in the instructor's practice and explores the potential and challenges of using these models for assessment purposes.}

This paper introduces a self-regulated learning processes, multimodal data, and analysis (SMA) grid and maps joint and individual research of the authors (63 papers) over the last five years onto the grid. This shows how multimodal data streams were used to investigate SRL processes. The two-dimensional space on the SMA grid is helpful for visualizing the relations and possible combinations between the data streams and how the measurement of SRL processes. This overview serves as an analytical introduction to the current special issue “Advancing SRL Research with Artificial Intelligence (AI)” and we encourage to position new research and unexplored frontiers. We emphasize the need for intensive and strategic collaboration to accelerate progress using new interdisciplinary methods to develop accurate measurement of SRL in educational technologies.}

Driven by developments in the emerging field of learning analytics, these technologies adjust problems based on learners' performance. Yet, until now it is largely unclear how students regulate their learning with ALTs. Hence, we explored how learners regulate their effort, accuracy and learning with an ALT using moment-by-moment learning curves. The results indicated that moment-by-moment learning curves did reflect students’ accuracy and learning, but no associations with effort were found. Immediate drops were associated with high prior knowledge and suboptimal learning. Immediate peaks were associated with robust learning and pointed to effective student regulation. Close multiple spikes showed moderate learning and lower initial levels of accuracy but, with system support, these students seemed able to regulate their learning. Separated multiple spikes indicated reduced learning and accuracy and potentially signal the inability of students to regulate their learning. In this light, moment-by-moment learning curves seem to be valuable indicators of accuracy regulation during learning with ALTs and could potentially be used in interventions to support SRL with personalized visualizations.}

Big Data is a suitable paradigm for real-time processing of large data sets concerning the LS, in the final aim to provide valuable information that may improve the CL experience. Besides, the adoption of Big Data offers the opportunity to implement a non-intrusive and in-process evaluation strategy of online courses that complements the traditional and time-consuming ways to collect feedback (e.g. questionnaires or surveys). Although the application of Big Data in the CL domain is a recent explored research area with limited applications, it may have an important role in the future of online education. By adopting the design science research methodology, this article describes a novel method and approach to analyse individual students' contributions in online learning activities and assess the level of their satisfaction towards the course. A software artefact is also presented, which leverages Learning Analytics in a Big Data context, with the goal to provide in real-time valuable insights that people and systems can use to intervene properly in the program.

Researchers seem unanimous in their view of the importance of SRL in modern online and blended educational settings; this is borne out by number of reviews of literature on the subject. There has, as yet, been no systematic treatment of SRL in the context of its conceptualisation as a phenomenon that unfolds in sequences over time. To address this limitation, this review explores the corpus of work (n = 53) in which SRL and its related dimensions are analysed through the lenses of temporality, sequence and order. The results show that, in the pursuit of validity and impact, key decisions need to be addressed in regard to theoretical grounding, data collection, and analytic methods. Based on these outcomes, we propose a framework of directives and questions to aid researchers who want to push forward the field. This framework comprises four sub-areas: i) methodological considerations, relating to data capture and analytic processes; ii) theoretical considerations, relating to the usage of models of self-regulated learning and their related dimensions; iii) validity considerations, relating to the robustness of the chosen analytic outcomes studied; and iv) temporal considerations, relating to the articulation of analytic outcomes in the context of temporality and sequence.}

Highly autonomous settings, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), put additional pressure on learners in this regard. However, little is known about how learners organise their time in terms of sessions or blocks of time across a MOOC. This study examined session behavioural data of 9272 learners in a MOOC and its relation to their engagement, grade and self-report data measuring aspects of self-regulated learning (SRL). From an exploratory temporal approach using clustering and group comparison tests, we examined how learners distributed sessions in relation to their length and frequency across the course (macro aspect), and which types of activities they prioritised within these sessions (micro aspect). We then investigated if these patterns of sessions were related to learners' level of engagement, achievement and use of self-regulated learning (SRL) skills. We found that successful learners had more frequent and longer sessions across the course, mixed up activities within sessions, and changed the focus of activities within sessions across the course. In addition, session distribution was found to be a meaningful proxy for learners’ use of SRL skills related to time management and effort regulation. That is, learners with higher levels of time management and effort regulation had longer and more sessions across the course. Based on the results, implications for supporting specific session behaviours to promote effective learning in MOOCs are discussed.}

In this paper, we propose a framework (CIDA) for collective inquiry in such professional communities of teachers. Based on other collective inquiry frameworks for knowledge building, we propose three interconnected components: the inquiry process, the collective process, and technological support to facilitate and study teachers’ design practices in technological environments. We explain the framework with examples of implemented technologies and present empirical results of three cases; two High schools and a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC). Results inform further how our framework can be implemented in practice and its required supports to facilitate knowledge building for inquiry communities of teachers.}

To provide personalization, health professions programs need to leverage both: (1) the technical infrastructure and analysis for existing student data, and (2) understand the interrelated contexts of learning, teaching, and expertise development within the clinical context. Personalization is more than feeding back results to learners; it also moves into intelligent tutors. Tips for successful adoption of personalization in health professions education, including security, legal, and administrative concerns, are discussed.}

abstract = {E-book learning platforms are increasingly used as curriculum resources for independent reading at school and home, although benefits for students’ reading motivation and skill are unclear. Using a set of analytic tools, this study describes two e-book learning platforms in terms of platform affordances, digital architecture of e-books, functionality of screen pages and dashboard analytics. Qualitative analyses reveal patterns of strength and weakness along each dimension. Affordances rated highest in content and administration characteristics, but largely unmet in accessibility and communication. Architecture tends to maximize text access, but minimize text/media integration and active reader engagement. Functionality suggests a word-focused pattern that favors word learning over text comprehension. Analytics tend to inform skill building over self-awareness and progress. Analytic tools were designed and/or refined to develop and improve technical adequacy. Findings lay the groundwork for more controlled studies of the effectiveness of e-book platforms as literacy curriculum resources and more active collaboration among publishers, IT developers and educators to improve e-book platform quality.}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the perception gap (i.e., importance and satisfaction) of university librarians regarding authentication services, and their attitudes towards the visualization of online libraries' usage logs. Moreover, this study developed a dashboard platform to visualize readers' behavior when using online resources and to understand university librarians' attitudes towards the library statistics dashboard. As a result, it was found that one system quality attribute and two information quality attributes were identified as high priorities for the intervention. University librarians gave positive feedback on the library statistics dashboard that can present visualizations of the authentication logs to further explore patron behavior of using e-resources. This also shows that the results can help identify strategic focus areas to evaluate authentication systems and library statistics dashboard as alternative technologies to assist university librarians in exploring patrons' e-resource usage behaviors.}

Because self-regulated learning is critical to success in online learning, measures reflecting self-regulated learning were included to examine the relationship between LMS data measures and course achievement. Data were collected from 530 college students who took an online course. The results demonstrated that students' regular study, late submissions of assignments, number of sessions (the frequency of course logins), and proof of reading the course information packets significantly predicted their course achievement. These findings verify the importance of self-regulated learning and reveal the advantages of using measures related to meaningful learning behaviors rather than simple frequency measures. Furthermore, the measures collected in the middle of the course significantly predicted course achievement, and the findings support the potential for early prediction using learning performance data. Several implications of these findings are discussed.}

Preparing the future health care professional workforce in a changing world is a significant undertaking. Educators and other decision makers look to evidence-based knowledge to improve quality of education. Analytics, the use of data to generate insights and support decisions, have been applied successfully across numerous application domains. Health care professional education is one area where great potential is yet to be realized. Previous research of Academic and Learning analytics has mainly focused on technical issues. The focus of this study relates to its practical implementation in the setting of health care education.
Objective
The aim of this study is to create a conceptual model for a deeper understanding of the synthesizing process, and transforming data into information to support educators’ decision making.
Methods
A deductive case study approach was applied to develop the conceptual model.
Results
The analytics loop works both in theory and in practice. The conceptual model encompasses the underlying data, the quality indicators, and decision support for educators.
Conclusions
The model illustrates how a theory can be applied to a traditional data-driven analytics approach, and alongside the context- or need-driven analytics approach.}

Additionally, learning data is often inaccessible to teachers or served in a manner that fails to support or inform their teaching and design practice. We need systematic, learner-centred ways for teachers to design learning data that supports them. Drawing on decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research, we show how to make use of important AIED concepts: (1) learner models; (2) Open Learner Models (OLMs); (3) scrutability and (4) Ontologies. We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject. Finally, we present a research agenda for making this process both easier and more powerful.}

In strategies like the flipped classroom, students need to follow a specific learning pathway to complete certain activities in the LMS before class. This includes watching videos and completing readings and quizzes, to prepare for hands-on exercises during classroom time. Consistent student engagement with this approach is vital for success – but in large subjects with hundreds of enrolments, monitoring that engagement is a complex task. Using the data collected in an LMS, this paper presents an approach for detecting significant changes in student engagement in hybrid learning environments. The approach uses Process Mining (PM), a family of tools and techniques to analyze data through a process lens, to compare students' learning pathways between pairs of learning windows (e.g., weeks in a semester). Using a real-life event log containing more than 26,000 interactions of 194 students over a full semester, the findings demonstrate the approach's ability to detect changes in student engagement over time. These insights can be used by educators to refine their instructional design, deliver targeted interventions, and ultimately improve the overall effectiveness of hybrid learning.}

As a consequence, Learning Analytics in mobile learning requires original methodological approaches which enrich techniques already tested in different learning contexts (e.g., in Virtual Learning Environments) with specific strategies to deal with the complexity of mobile learning and manage the corresponding datasets. This paper presents a task-interaction framework to support educational decision-making in mobile learning. The framework is based on the relationships between the different types of interactions occurring in a mobile learning activity and the tasks which are pedagogically relevant for the learning activity.

Yet, many students struggle with self-regulated learning (SRL) skills and prefer traditional learning methods. The use of SRL relies on both students' motivation and skills but it is unclear how these skills evolve over time since many previous studies often overlook the temporal effects of interventions. To address these challenges, we introduced a gamified self-regulated flipped learning (GSRFL) approach. This approach integrates gamification elements and self-regulation supports, such as a learning analytics dashboard, to motivate and aid students' behaviors across three main SRL stages: planning, execution, and self-evaluation. We conducted a longitudinal quasi-experimental study with first-year university students to examine the impact on their SRL behaviors. The longitudinal study offers a considerable methodological advantage by providing detailed information about an intervention's impact over time. The experimental group (N = 76) utilized the GSRFL approach, while the control group (N = 75) employed the same self-regulated flipped learning approach but without gamification. Results showed that gamification significantly improved students' English learning achievement and overall SRL behaviors. Longitudinal observations revealed a positive main intervention effect on metacognitive monitoring behaviors, despite a natural decline in SRL behaviors over time. Gamification effectively moderated the decline of underutilized SRL strategies like goal setting and time management. These results underscore gamification's potential to enhance academic performance and promote SRL skills.}

To initially alleviate this problem, this study develops a learning fatigue detection system using a multimodal approach with ECG and video signals, classifying a learner’s state into three categories: alert, normal, and fatigued. To validate performance, the proposed system is tested on (i) an open-source dataset DROZY (n = 35) and (ii) a self-collected dataset captured in a learning environment (n = 92). The experimental results based on 10-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the system outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a detection accuracy of 99.6% and 91.8% on the two datasets, respectively.}

Students were instructed to complete online self-assessment in the form of formative quizzes after class. We performed clustering analysis, which revealed three behavioral patterns in online self-assessment, and we compared the learning performance of students across different patterns. The results indicated that students who frequently took the online assessments after class tended to achieve a higher examination score than those who did not. However, the learning performance of students who demonstrated nonstandard behaviors did not necessarily improve, even though they actively took the assessments. Our results suggest that student behavior is a critical factor in improving learning through self-assessment. These findings provide insights for researchers in the learning analytics field as well as for practitioners who wish to adopt online self-assessment for learning.}

abstract = {Dashboards have been hypothesized to facilitate adaptive guidance in classrooms. Thus far, however, empirical studies in this domain are badly missing. We present a dashboard, which enables teachers to observe concurrent groups as they engage in mathematical tasks using Dynamic Geometry tools and to guide groups when their intervention is needed. We rely on a case study with this dashboard in which a single teacher could successfully orchestrate the progression of several groups working on difficult problems in geometry, when being sent realtime alerts about critical moments, moments whose occurrence may impinge on further co-construction of knowledge. In the present study, we chose six 20-min long demo videos of small groups in a variety of sessions of unguided group work, where each video describes the work of one of six small groups (dyads or triads) dealing simultaneously with identical set tasks. Two versions of this demo were prepared, one with alerts of critical moments generated according to predefined rules, and the other without alerts. The teachers observing concurrent groups and being updated about critical moments (N1 = 21) better understand progression in groups than teachers that are not informed about these critical moments (N2 = 18). In a second study we found that the dispatching of alerts impinges on the ways the teachers navigate across rooms. In particular, they pay attention to certain alerts and at the same time, focus on learning processes in mathematics. We conclude that such tools may help bringing collaborative settings more often in classrooms.}

While Coursera, edX, Udacity, and FutureLearn received most of the attention and scrutiny, an entirely new ecosystem of local MOOC providers was growing in parallel. This ecosystem is harder to study than the major players: they are spread around the world, have less staff devoted to maintaining research data, and operate in multiple languages with university and corporate regional partners. To better understand how online learning opportunities are expanding through this regional MOOC ecosystem, we created a research partnership among 15 different MOOC providers from nine countries. We gathered data from over eight million learners in six thousand MOOCs, and we conducted a large-scale survey with more than 10 thousand participants. From our analysis, we argue that these regional providers may be better positioned to meet the goals of expanding access to higher education in their regions than the better-known global providers. To make this claim we highlight three trends: first, regional providers attract a larger local population with more inclusive demographic profiles; second, students predominantly choose their courses based on topical interest, and regional providers do a better job at catering to those needs; and third, many students feel more at ease learning from institutions they already know and have references from. Our work raises the importance of local education in the global MOOC ecosystem, while calling for additional research and conversations across the diversity of MOOC providers.}

Procrastinatory behaviour is often associated with a relative lack of self-regulatory skills that would otherwise help learners to resist distractions and to progress in learning. This paper reports a pilot study, conducted with 49 online learners, in which we describe the use of a virtual learning assistant as a tool for collecting online learners' web navigation behaviour. As this virtual learning assistant operates as an extension to the Chrome web browser, it is possible that data collection is achieved independently of, and beyond specific learning management systems. Furthermore, the study opens up the possibility of leveraging the collected dataset for visual learning analytics and pattern mining. To demonstrate the potential utility of the virtual learning assistant, we present an example for a detailed examination of a learner's web navigation behaviour. The results of the detailed examination of a single learner's web navigation behaviour over 333 days, presented as a case study, revealed the presence of seasonality in accessing certain web resources and stable sequential patterns in the learner's web navigation that can be associated with procrastinatory behaviour.}

However, when applied to universities, analytical systems have been less successful. In order to deal with this issue, several approaches have appeared recently, most of them under the umbrella of learning analytics. These new systems tend to be very focused and not sponsored by university leaders, as contraposition to BI systems. This leads to some problems when generalizing or adapting the created systems to institutional level. Therefore, there are two analytical approaches in universities: one focused on management and with institutional support and the other focused on the university activities without institutional support. We believe that both approaches should be joined to create institutional and transversal analytical information systems for universities. The purpose of this work is to put forward this idea, demonstrating that developing analytical information systems in universities is a grand challenge for information systems research.}

The research on MOOCs has risen exponentially during the last years and there have been a number of works focused on studying collaboration. However, these previous studies have been restricted to the analysis of collaboration based on the forum and social interactions, without taking into account other possibilities such as the synchronicity in the interactions with the platform. Therefore, in this work we performed a case study with the goal of implementing a data-driven approach to detect and characterize collaboration in MOOCs. We applied an algorithm to detect synchronicity links based on their submission times to quizzes as an indicator of collaboration, and applied it to data from two large Coursera MOOCs. We found three different profiles of user accounts, that were grouped in couples and larger communities exhibiting different types of associations between user accounts. The characterization of these user accounts suggested that some of them might represent genuine online learning collaborative associations, but that in other cases dishonest behaviors such as free-riding or multiple account cheating might be present. These findings call for additional research on the study of the kind of collaborations that can emerge in online settings.}

Adapted learning systems can exploit this data to analyze students’ behavior and help them be more successful in their learning process. In this paper, we propose an approach that is new in data mining, which consists of representing the behavioral dynamics of a set of students through Behavioral Primitives. A Behavioral Primitive represents the temporal evolution of learning indicators to model the behavior of a group of students. The primitive then corresponds to a dynamic distribution, representing both the mean values and the variance of specific indicators over time. We experiment this method on a known, widely used, and open dataset (OULAD). Our results confirm the relevance of the proposed methodology to characterize students’ behaviors intelligibly and visually while respecting each student's anonymity. Our work provides a powerful and explainable tool for educational actors. It allows them to analyze learners’ behaviors and perform pedagogical actions.}

To that end, we employed game-based learning methodologies and Game Learning Analytics (GLA) to systematize the design and evaluation of an AR-based serious game to teach programming. We evaluated our game for usability and effectiveness by conducting a user study on twenty-seven undergraduate students. The evaluation primarily consisted of a learning test conducted twice – before and after playing the game – along with a usability questionnaire that players completed after playing the game. Our results showed that players made significant progress after playing the game. The game helped players improve their basic programming skills, especially for the group having lower prior programming skills. The results highlighted various ways in which GLA can be used to benefit different stakeholders in the game. Based on players’ qualitative responses, we also identified several areas of improvement, most prominently the trade-off between ease of use and game complexity. We provide suggestions and discuss implications for future work.}

This data can be analyzed to provide a deep insight into the effect of the game on its players. However, traditional techniques to assess players of serious games make little use of interaction data, relying instead on costly external questionnaires. We propose an evidence-based process to improve the assessment of players by using their interaction data. The process first combines player interaction data and traditional questionnaires to derive and refine game learning analytics variables, which can then be used to predict the effects of the game on its players. Once the game is validated, and suitable prediction models have been built, the prediction models can be used in large-scale deployments to assess players solely based on their interactions, without the need for external questionnaires. We briefly describe two case studies where this combination of traditional questionnaires and data mining techniques has been successfully applied. The evidence-based assessment process proposed radically simplifies the deployment and application of serious games in real class settings.}

When we focus on assessment, we can launch a new source of data that can be analyzed and hence contribute to the improvement of the field of learning analytics. In fact, we discuss the suitability of xAPI standard to track the assessment data and try to enhance its data model to support effectively the assessment analytics. An ontological model is proposed supporting assessment analytics purpose based on the weaknesses of the xAPI data model from assessment point of view. Since our proposed pattern is an ontological model, this gives us the chance to reason about the assessment data by performing some logic rules edited with SWRL(Semantic Web Rule Language) for supporting inference mechanisms related to the leaner level according to its assessment performance.}

abstract = {Background
Health care organizations increasingly depend on business intelligence tools, including “dashboards,” to capture, analyze, and present data on performance metrics. Ideally, dashboards allow users to quickly visualize actionable data to inform and optimize clinical and organizational performance. In reality, dashboards are typically embedded in complex health care organizations with massive data streams and end users with distinct needs. Thus, designing effective dashboards is a challenging task and theoretical underpinnings of health care dashboards are poorly characterized; even the concept of the dashboard remains ill-defined. Researchers, informaticists, clinical managers, and health care administrators will benefit from a clearer understanding of how dashboards have been developed, implemented, and evaluated, and how the design, end user, and context influence their uptake and effectiveness.
Objective
This scoping review first aims to survey the vast published literature of “dashboards” to describe where, why, and for whom they are used in health care settings, as well as how they are developed, implemented, and evaluated. Further, we will examine how dashboard design and content is informed by intended purpose and end users.
Methods
In July 2020, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for peer-reviewed literature using a targeted strategy developed with a research librarian and retrieved 5188 results. Following deduplication, 3306 studies were screened in duplicate for title and abstract. Any abstracts mentioning a health care dashboard were retrieved in full text and are undergoing duplicate review for eligibility. Articles will be included for data extraction and analysis if they describe the development, implementation, or evaluation of a dashboard that was successfully used in routine workflow. Articles will be excluded if they were published before 2015, the full text is unavailable, they are in a non-English language, or they describe dashboards used for public health tracking, in settings where direct patient care is not provided, or in undergraduate medical education. Any discrepancies in eligibility determination will be adjudicated by a third reviewer. We chose to focus on articles published after 2015 and those that describe dashboards that were successfully used in routine practice to identify the most recent and relevant literature to support future dashboard development in the rapidly evolving field of health care informatics.
Results
All articles have undergone dual review for title and abstract, with a total of 2019 articles mentioning use of a health care dashboard retrieved in full text for further review. We are currently reviewing all full-text articles in duplicate. We aim to publish findings by mid-2022. Findings will be reported following guidance from the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist.
Conclusions
This scoping review will provide stakeholders with an overview of existing dashboard tools, highlighting the ways in which dashboards have been developed, implemented, and evaluated in different settings and for different end user groups, and identify potential research gaps. Findings will guide efforts to design and use dashboards in the health care sector more effectively.

In our research we target to investigate how to support this systematic reflection process with educational data analytics methods and tools from both the design and the delivery of Inquiry-based educational designs (IED). The contribution of this paper is to propose a novel “Teaching and Learning” Analytics method and research prototype tool, extending the scope of purely learning analytics methods, to analyze IED in terms of the tool-supported guidance they offer and relate these analyses to students' educational data that are already being collected by existing learning analytics systems, increasing teachers' awareness. A two-layer evaluation methodology positively assessed the capacity of our method to analyze IED and provided initial evidence that the insights generated offer statistically significant indicators that impact students' activity during the delivery of these IED.

In the year 2020, the world of education has been challenged by the global pandemic of COVID-19, causing educational institutions to rapidly reconfigure teaching and assessment strategies. With the suspension of traditional courses, institutions have been forced to adopt distance teaching and assessment methods. In this context, the development and use of online learning platforms have become essential to ensure the continuity of the educational process. Focusing on universities, this article proposes to highlight the crucial importance of online educational platforms in optimizing students’ assessment. The goal is to develop a university platform that facilitates both the student evaluation process and effective communication between students and teachers. Thus, this article aims to explore in depth how online educational platforms can influence and improve the process of student assessment in universities. This paper brings to the fore the essential role that technology plays in educating future generations and preparing them for the challenges of a world in continuous transformation. We present our proposed platform that can be used to evaluate the students in automatically way.}

Many educational institutions are offering various types of online courses and e-content. The analytical models from data mining and computer science heuristics help in analysis and visualization of data, predicting student performance, generating recommendations for students as well as teachers, providing feedback to students, identifying related courses, e-content and books, detecting undesirable student behaviours, developing course contents and in planning various other educational activities. Today many educational institutions are using data analytics for improving the services they provide. The data access patterns about students, logged and collected from online educational learning systems could be explored to find informative relationships in the educational world. But a major concern is that the data are exploding, as numbers of students and courses are increasing day by day all over the world. The usage of Big Data platforms and parallel programming models like MapReduce may accelerate the analysis of exploding educational data and computational pattern finding capability.

abstract = {Aim
This study aimed to explore the factors influencing undergraduate nursing students' use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in their studies, examining how this usage shapes their learning experiences and perceptions of traditional pedagogical approaches.
Background
The integration of AI into healthcare is rapidly transforming clinical practice, which in turn necessitates a corresponding shift in nursing education. While AI's potential benefits and challenges in education are widely discussed, limited research has focused on how nursing students specifically use these tools in their nursing studies and how this impacts their learning processes.
Design
A qualitative study employing exploratory and descriptive designs.
Methods
Participants were recruited from an undergraduate nursing program at a tertiary university. Thematic analysis was used to analyze interview data.
Results
Key findings revealed that nursing students use AI for personalized learning, bridging the theory-practice gap and managing time constraints. International students particularly found AI valuable for cultural adaptation and language support. A significant finding was the "open secret" of AI use, with students actively using tools despite institutional discouragement, highlighting a disconnect between student needs and institutional practices. Ethical concerns, such as bias, data privacy and accountability, were also prominent.
Conclusion
This study provides novel insights into the student-driven demand for AI integration in nursing education. It highlights the need for institutional responsiveness, transparency and the development of ethical AI frameworks. By acknowledging student agency and fostering collaborative dialogue, nursing education can leverage AI's benefits effectively while upholding the profession's core values: compassion, empathy and human-centered care.}

abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation’s companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies.}

Recommender systems can help teachers make choices and hence personalize the learning environment. However, few studies have investigated how teachers use recommender systems in their practice. Educational recommender systems also require more investigation into how teachers assess recommendations to provide better systems in the future. Therefore, this research aimed to provide a better insight into the practical application of a teacher-centric educational recommender system, conduct a user-centric evaluation of the recommender system, and present teacher beliefs on the use of educational recommender systems for personalized learning. Our results indicated that teachers similarly used the recommender system by creating new lessons rather than adapting suggested lessons. Their evaluations of the recommender system highlighted the importance of accuracy and utility. Diversity and serendipity were considered to be less important. Teachers perceived recommender systems as a first step to personalized learning and as a tool for simplifying such learning. However, the current system did not affect the quality of personalized learning. Based on these results, we propose to focus more on accuracy and utility as opposed to diversity and serendipity for teacher-centric recommender system evaluation. For personalized learning, we conclude that, according to teachers, recommender systems can lead to more effective personalization by allowing teachers to focus on student needs.}

Students with varying learning levels from Saudi Arabian universities started online lessons through programs and applications. Supporters and opponents of distance learning have different opinions about distance education. In this context, this study focused on actual quality standards of distance learning and identified five axes of education quality to improve learning and develop technical tools for learning. The findings of the study are relevant to the specific context of the crisis and aim to meet international quality standards. We adopted the social survey method using the five axes. A questionnaire and a study sample of 1240 respondents from 42 universities and colleges were used. The data determined the level of quality of distance education and the extent to which students benefit from it. The interactive axis achieved the highest average rating, whereas the evaluation axis achieved the lowest average rating. Furthermore, the study shows that students agreed that distance education was useful during the pandemic, but it is less effective than face-to-face learning, and they value the elements of live lessons and interactions. These findings can be used to develop teaching practices in distance learning through the adoption of technology in line with global trends; through the use of learning to overcome difficulties; through open, unlimited areas of learning during crises; and through the development and activation of these dynamics. These outcomes can deliver higher results at a desired scientific level.}

However, LLMs still face several challenges, including hallucination and static internal knowledge, which hinder their reliability in educational settings. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and incorporating it into the LLM's generation process. This approach improves factual accuracy and enables dynamic knowledge updates, making LLMs particularly suitable for educational applications. In this paper, we comprehensively review existing research that integrates RAG into educational scenarios. We first clarify the definition and workflow of RAG, and following the indexing mechanism of RAG, we introduce different types of retrievers and generation optimization methods. As the main focus of this work, we explore the practical applications of RAG in education, covering interactive learning systems, generation and assessment of educational content, and large-scale deployment in educational ecosystems. Based on our comprehensive review, this paper discusses existing challenges and future directions, including mitigating hallucinations, ensuring the completeness and timeliness of retrieved knowledge, reducing computational costs, and enhancing multimodal support for RAG-based educational applications.}

With increasing use of social networks among university learners, its role in communication channels in connectivists teaching context needs examination.
Aims
This study investigates the role of communication channels in social networks as learners engage in a negotiation simulation RPG.
Samples
The current study collects data from 20 groups of learners in a fully online modality where learners are engaged in the negotiation simulation RPG.
Methods
Set in a fully online class, using a RPG that requires high levels of communication among participants, communication channel use is measured. Behavior data tracks actions between groups in the learning RPG database, allowing social network analysis.
Results
Results show social network apps are most often used by learners for both intra and intergroup conversations. Surprisingly, increased inter-group communication does not always improve learner performance in a connectivist setting. Instead, each additional communication quickly improves performance up to a certain point. After that point, more communication does not necessarily lead to better performance.
Conclusion
Instructors and administrators need to find ways to welcome technology platforms, like social media, into the classroom. However, social media platforms are in no way designed to fit a specific class and bring their own set of issues that can run counter to the class goals or instructional methods.}

We compared the differences in the complexity of the SRL process and the regularity of SRL behaviors between the high and low performers. We found that the SRL processes of the high performers were more complex than those of the low performers. In general, the low performers demonstrated a higher degree of repetition of SRL behaviors than the high performers. The low performers were also more likely to exhibit a behavior repeatedly than the high performers.

Building on personalized education and adaptive learning systems models, this review provides an analytic framework to summarize key features of personalized feedback implementations and main empirical results. The systematic literature search resulted in 39 studies published in the last ten years. We found that scholars developed and investigated personalized feedback on the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale of digital learning environments. However, the adaptive sources (To what is feedback adapted?) are mainly restricted to the current knowledge level and learning behavior data. Other interesting data sources for feedback adaptation remain underresearched, e.g., emotional state measures, progress measures, learning goals, or personality traits. Only a minority of the reviewed studies provided an empirical or theoretical rationale for assigning feedback messages to different types of students. Most studies report positive or at least mixed or neutral effects of personalized feedback on educational outcomes. This review discusses several implications for future directions in research on digitalized and personalized feedback. This study also adds to previous literature reviews on automatic and adaptive feedback that did not clearly distinguish task-adaptiveness and student-adaptiveness in digital feedback examples.}

While some related systems, such as Capture The Flag platforms, have been available for almost one decade, platforms that support full-fledged cybersecurity training exercises have only been released as open source in recent years. Given the complexity of such cybersecurity training platforms, the question that arises is how to meaningfully evaluate and compare their capabilities in order to identify the most suitable solution for a given type of organization and/or training activity. In this paper, we introduce a capability assessment methodology for cybersecurity training platforms that focuses on the three key aspects of training: content representation, environment management, and training facilitation. The assessment tool that we developed is used to evaluate two open-source cybersecurity training platforms, CyTrONE and KYPO. We then conduct a comparative analysis of these two platforms based on our first-hand developer experience with them, and discuss the lessons learned from implementing, deploying and using these platforms. The assessment tool and the detailed technical comparative analysis that we conducted are intended as instruments and references for anyone who plans to deploy or develop cybersecurity training platforms.}

While the majority of the extant research indicates that the use of learning technologies can increase learning effectiveness, instructors of management courses lack clear guidance on how to develop effective blended learning environments. Therefore, this paper aims to derive an instructional design for a blended learning environment from available research results, which can then be used by instructors of qualitative management modules, such as those focused on entrepreneurship, marketing, or strategy. We first provide an overview of the antecedents of learning effectiveness in blended management education, which can be attributed to the learners themselves or to the learning environment. These antecedents influence cognitive processing in the human memory. Based on these insights, we develop a design proposal for a blended learning environment to deliver qualitative management content. In particular, we suggest a flipped format in which learners acquire and construct knowledge in advance, while classroom time is used for interactive discussions and applications. Finally, we discuss implications for business schools wishing to effectively implement such a learning environment that enables contemporary education and may eventually become their next value proposition.}

New digital technologies are making a great revolution by transforming all aspects of education in teaching, learning, assessment, and feedback. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the proliferation of digital education and its replacement of traditional education in the educational system. The developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are indispensable in all sectors, including education. AI-integrated learning helps management, teachers, students, parents, and other stakeholders gain insight into their performance to impact the process positively. This chapter aims to throw light on the emerging need and technologies used for digital education and to examine the role of AI in education with examples from the perspectives of teaching, learning, and assessment in the new normal. The application of AI in education and its effectiveness is explored through six publicly available datasets along with strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, challenges, and the future of digital education. This chapter discusses several examples and benefits of AI applications that enhance the educational experience and also emphasizes the need to align it with technology and curriculum to achieve the intended learning outcomes.}

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a Scopus database-based search identified 551 publications related to DS in education. The results show significant growth in publications since 2014, reflecting increased awareness and investment in DS for improving education quality. The United States leads in contributions, accounting for 45.92 % of the total documents, followed by the United Kingdom (6.53 %) and India (6.35 %). Co-occurrence analysis reveals three main clusters: DS approaches, student interactions with learning, and data analysis techniques. This study identifies key research trends and challenges, including limited infrastructure, skills gaps among educators, and privacy concerns, while addressing gaps in the literature regarding the long-term impact and contextualization of DS in education. The findings indicate DS's impact on curriculum innovation, personalized learning, and data-driven decision-making. These insights not only offer a comprehensive understanding of the current state of DS in education but also provide actionable recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers to enhance DS integration and address existing challenges through a multidisciplinary approach.}

GBLA research examines patterns of behaviors evident in game data logs for the measurement of implicit learning—the development of unarticulated knowledge that is not yet expressible on a test or formal assessment. This paper reports on the study of two digital games showing how the combination of human coding with EDM has enabled researchers to measure implicit learning of Physics. In the game Impulse, researchers combined human coding of video with educational data mining to create a set of automated detectors of students' implicit understanding of Newtonian mechanics. For Quantum Spectre, an optics puzzle game, human coding of Interaction Networks was used to identify common student errors. Findings show that several of our measures of student implicit learning within these games were significantly correlated with improvements in external postassessments. Methods and detailed findings were different for each type of game. These results suggest GBLA shows promise for future work such as adaptive games and in-class, data-driven formative assessments, but design of the assessment mechanics must be carefully crafted for each game.}

This review uses the lens of visual analytics to examine four dimensions of visual representations for analysing collaborative discourse: goals, data sources, visualisation designs, and analytical techniques based on 89 studies. We found visual analysis approaches to be suitable and advantageous for decomposing the temporality of collaborative discourse. However, it has been challenging for current research to simultaneously consider learning theories and follow visualisation design principles when adopting visualisations to analyse collaborative discourse. At the same time, existing visual analysis approaches have mainly targeted learners or researchers in online contexts and mainly focused on mirroring collaborative discourse rather than providing advanced affordances such as alerting or advising. Informed by these findings, we propose a possible future research agenda and offer suggestions for the features of successful collaboration to guide the design of advanced affordances.}

Five empirical articles illustrated how mobile devices afford resources to learners and how new channels of data afford researchers new insight into learning processes. Authors of two invited commentaries note the challenges involved in researching mobile learning, which unfolds across multiple contexts and can involve novel tools, multiple learners, and instructors and experts. These authors propose a taxonomy that can organize research that investigates interactions amongst learners, instructors, experts, and tools across one or more physical contexts, as well as a research agenda that would empirically test and refine assumptions made by mobile learning theorists. In this commentary, the editorial team proposes that mobile and psychological theories may be improved through convergence. Theories of mobile learning can be advanced by adopting practices previously employed to refine psychological theories of learning, whereas conducting research using mobile devices (and the data they provide) can further refine psychological theories of learning. We illustrate these positions with examples, and consider how instruction must be designed and how learners must be prepared in order to benefit from learning using mobile technology.}

abstract = {Background
In a previous study, a prototype mobile health (mHealth) app was co-designed with patients, family physicians, and researchers to enhance self-management and optimize conservative management for patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA).
Objective
This study aims to evaluate the overall usability, quality, and effectiveness of the mHealth app prototype for aiding knee OA self-management from the perspectives of patients with OA and health care providers (HCPs).
Methods
Using methods triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data, we conducted a pilot evaluation of an mHealth app prototype that was codeveloped with patients and HCPs. We recruited adult patients aged ≥20 years with early knee OA (n=18) who experienced knee pain on most days of the month at any time in the past and HCPs (n=7) to participate. In the qualitative assessment, patient and HCP perspectives were elicited on the likeability and usefulness of app features and functionalities and the perceived impact of the app on patient-HCP communication. The quantitative assessment involved evaluating the app using usability, quality, and effectiveness metrics. Patient baseline assessments included a semistructured interview and survey to gather demographics and assess the quality of life (European Quality-of-Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L]) and patient activation (patient activation measure [PAM]). Following the 6-week usability trial period, a follow-up survey assessed patients’ perceptions of app usability and quality and longitudinal changes in quality of life and patient activation. Semistructured interviews and surveys were also conducted with HCPs (n=7) at baseline to evaluate the usability and quality of the app prototype.
Results
Interviews with patients and HCPs revealed overall positive impressions of the app prototype features and functionalities related to likeability and usefulness. Between the baseline and follow-up patient assessments, the mean EQ-5D-5L scores improved from 0.77 to 0.67 (P=.04), and PAM scores increased from 80.4 to 87.9 (P=.01). Following the 6-week evaluation, patients reported a mean System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 57.8, indicating marginal acceptability according to SUS cutoffs. The mean number of goals set during the usability period was 2.47 (SD 3.08), and the mean number of activities completed for knee OA self-management during the study period was 22.2 (SD 17.8). Spearman rank correlation (rs) calculations revealed that the follow-up PAM scores were weakly correlated (rs=−0.32) with the number of goals achieved and the number (rs=0.19) of activities performed during the 6-week usability period. HCPs reported a mean SUS score of 39.1, indicating unacceptable usability.
Conclusions
This evidence-based and patient-centered app prototype represents a potential use of mHealth for improving outcomes and enhancing conservative care by promoting patient activation and patient-HCP communication regarding OA management. However, future iterations of the app prototype are required to address the limitations related to usability and quality.}

To handle such a large amount of data, it is effective to use a cloud computing environment. However, because LMS log data contain much personal information, it is often necessary to anonymise or pseudonymise the data to use them in cloud computing environment. In this study, we implemented a log analysis environment that combines an organisation’s internal server and a cloud computing environment by using the GakuNin-Cloud on-demand configuration service provided by the National Institute of Informatics (NII). In this environment, LMS logs are stored in the cloud with pseudonymisation, and the pseudonymisation is automatically removed by a re-identification proxy when the logs need to be analysed. We applied the environment to the Moodle system at Gunma University. We also applied the environment to an example Moodle created by the GakuNin Cloud on-demand configuration service.}

OMO learning relies on hybrid infrastructure and open educational practices to merge online and offline (i.e., physical classrooms) learning spaces together in real-time while simultaneously seamlessly teaching students in both the physical classroom and online. A systematic design of the learning environment is therefore needed by identifying relevant areas and success factors that support the design process of the OMO Learning environment, based on conceptual, human-centered, and didactic principles. This research used a collective case study analysis technique. Specifically, four international OMO learning case studies were collected and analyzed. The findings demonstrated the significance of designing an active learning environment, selecting technology-based on representational and communication needs, and preparing spaces and teachers for OMO learning. Additionally, it is found that technology limitations are persistent in the OMO learning contexts, requiring teachers to carefully reflect on their course designs and to apply instructional strategies and workarounds to maximize learning, community building, and the student experience.}

In this study, a novel adaptive dimensionality reduction model is proposed using evolutionary computing and machine learning to better predict institute graduation rate. This work has explored the feature optimization capacity of evolutionary algorithm with weight assignment approach to each dimension. A high dimensional dataset is considered for analyzing attributes that affect institute graduation rates.

The “flipped” workshop consisted of three online lessons that cover the core materials on pinch design of heat exchanger networks, which the students were required to complete ahead of each of the corresponding three face-to-face class meetings, which focused on problem-solving exercises largely carried out by the students themselves. The paper describes the teaching methodology applied, presents and analyses the results of a survey conducted to assess the students’ perceptions and degree of satisfaction with the workshop. Learning outcomes relevant to the workshop topic, that is, the ability to design and optimize heat exchanger networks in realistic plant-wide settings, are also presented and compared to those of previous years. The main conclusion is that the short workshop format can successfully achieve the learning objectives, even for relatively large class sizes. Evidently, this workshop can be taught effectively in this concentrated form provided that the workshop participants are given access to the online lessons in advance of the class exercises.}

In those studies, little is found on the pedagogical implementation of serious games and on how they have impacted project management education. In this article, we both discuss how serious games have impacted project management education and how they are implemented from a pedagogical perspective. We used an empirical research approach, based on qualitative observations. Observations included authors’ own usages of a project management serious game (the PM-Game) complemented with a synthesis of 10 years of observations and discussions with other teachers who had used this same PM-Game. Results showed that serious games may lead to educational changes such as moving toward active pedagogies, developing new competencies such as soft skills, and changing teachers-students relationship. For the pedagogical implementation, results showed that the serious game was implemented as an integrated concept including hybrid simulation modalities, and combining virtual and augmented learning aspects. In conclusion, serious games have the potential to trigger a change in project management education. But to fully benefit from the potential advantages of this change, they have to be designed, developed and implemented as an integrated gaming and learning concept.}

We conclude with three prerequisites for teachers' successful technology use in formative assessment practices: 1) clear definitions of formative assessment, 2) alignment between digital tools and pedagogical practice, and 3) data literacy to examine and interpret information and use this to improve students’ learning. The review also documents knowledge gaps in current research.}

AI has the potential to transform the social interactions in educational contexts among learners, teachers, and technologies. In this systematic mapping review, we focus on mapping and framing trends for educational applications of AI in simulation-based learning. Fifty-nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We coded and analyzed six mapped categories in this literature review: (1) the year-of-study trend, (2) methods, (3) AI technologies, (4) simulation, (5) study trends, and (6) learning principles and theories. To provide nuanced details from the included literature, we also synthesized three thematic trends: (1) AI built in virtual agents for simulation-based learning, (2) AI infused in simulation-based learning with affective computing, and (3) AI leveraged in simulation-based learning for assessments. Trend One builds on a general acknowledgement of virtual agents as a guide for situated learning. Trend Two posits the role of affective states in learning trajectories and suggests the related machine learning approaches. Trend Three discusses machine learning techniques and multimodal computing used for assessment and feedback. The paper concludes with implications and suggestions for research and practice in AI in education using simulation-based learning.}

abstract = {Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is known to be productive if well structured. In CSCL, students construct knowledge by performing learning tasks while communicating about their work. This communication is most often done through online written chats. Understanding what is happening in chats is important from both research and practical perspectives. From a research perspective, insight into chat content offers a window into student interaction and learning. From a more practical standpoint, insight into chat content can (potentially) be used to trigger supportive elements in CSCL environments (e.g., context-sensitive tips or conversational agents). The latter requires real-time, and therefore automated, analysis of the chats. Such an automated analysis is also helpful from the research perspective, since hand-coding of chats is a very time and labour-consuming activity. In this article, we propose a new machine learning-based system for automated coding of student chats, which we labelled ConSent. The core of ConSent is an algorithm that uses contextual information and sentence encoding to produce a reliable estimation of chat message content (i.e. code). To optimize usability, ConSent was designed in such a way that it can cover various topics and various languages. To evaluate our approach, we used two sets of chats coming from different topics (within the domain of physics) and different languages (Dutch and Portuguese). We tested different algorithm configurations, including two multilingual sentence encoders, to find the model that yields the best reliability. As a result, analysis revealed that ConSent models can perform with substantial reliability levels and are able to transfer reliable coding of chats in a similar topic and different language. Finally, we discuss how ConSent can form the basis for a conversational agent, we explain the limitations of our approach, and we indicate possible paths for future work to contribute towards reliable and transferable models.}

This paper presents a framework that considers the existing learnersourcing literature, the latest insights from the learning sciences and advances in AI to offer promising future directions for developing learnersourcing systems. The framework is designed around important questions and human-AI partnerships relating to four key aspects: (1) creating novel content, (2) evaluating the quality of the created content, (3) utilising learnersourced contributions of students and (4) enabling instructors to support students in the learnersourcing process. We then present two comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of the proposed framework in relation to two existing popular learnersourcing systems.}

As technology advances, data has become a valuable resource, and the emergence of analytics is often considered a recent development driven by accessible computing power. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on adopting analytics in Australian university libraries, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of the factors that influence university library professionals’' perceptions of adopting analytics. This research addresses the main question: What factors drive the adoption of data analytics in Australian university libraries? This qualitative study employs a single case study approach with multiple sites involving 16 university libraries and 25 participants. Data collection methods included document analysis and semi-structured interviews with university librarians and analytics experts. The results show that all UTAUT2 constructs - performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit - influence librarians' attitudes and motivations towards adopting analytics applications. Additionally, this study reveals additional factors beyond the original UTAUT2 model, including the absence of data analytics in LIS education curriculums, algorithm training, and data privacy concerns. The study identifies various benefits of analytics adoption in university libraries, such as enhanced collection development planning, insights into user behaviour, improved financial management, and demonstrating library value. However, challenges like skill shortages, complex IT configurations, and privacy legislation must be addressed to effectively implement data analytics. The findings contribute to our understanding of user acceptance of analytics in university libraries, providing valuable insights for library administrators and analytics vendors. By applying the UTAUT2 model, this research enriches our knowledge of technology adoption in the context of university libraries' analytics.}

Considering the existing literature on XAI, this paper argues that XAI in education has commonalities with the broader use of AI but also has distinctive needs. Accordingly, we first present a framework, referred to as XAI-ED, that considers six key aspects in relation to explainability for studying, designing and developing educational AI tools. These key aspects focus on the stakeholders, benefits, approaches for presenting explanations, widely used classes of AI models, human-centred designs of the AI interfaces and potential pitfalls of providing explanations within education. We then present four comprehensive case studies that illustrate the application of XAI-ED in four different educational AI tools. The paper concludes by discussing opportunities, challenges and future research needs for the effective incorporation of XAI in education.}

However, this complexity can lead to inaccurate predictions when concept drift occurs, or when a large number of features are used with a limited sample size. We investigate the performance of different machine learning pipelines on a data set with change in study behavior during the Covid-19 period. We demonstrate that (i) LASSO, a shrinkage estimator that reduces complexity and overfitting, outperforms several machine learning models under these circumstances, (ii) a linear regression relying on only two handcrafted features achieves higher accuracy and substantially less predictive bias than commonly used, more complex models with large feature sets. Due to their simplicity, these models can serve as a benchmark for future studies and a fallback model when substantial concept or covariate drift is encountered.}

Think-aloud protocols from 39 participants were collected and transcribed when they were learning TPACK by designing technology-infused lessons with nBrowser, a computer-based learning environment. Based on models, nine critical SRL events were retrieved from participants‘ think-aloud protocols and analyzed through sequential clustering analysis. The results show two SRL groups indicating distinct self-regulatory sequential patterns. One group had a shorter sequence length and dominantly enacted elaboration activities (Low-SRL group), while the other had longer sequence lengths and engaged in diverse SRL activities (High-regulation group). Relating to TPACK performance indicated by the quality of lesson plans, the results reveal that the participants in the High-SRL group outperformed their counterparts in the Low-SRL group. The findings are consistent with previous evidence and provide implications for practitioners about the importance of student teachers’ self-regulation trajectories.}

abstract = {Background
Hospitals routinely collect large amounts of administrative data such as length of stay, 28-day readmissions, and hospital-acquired complications; yet, these data are underused for continuing professional development (CPD). First, these clinical indicators are rarely reviewed outside of existing quality and safety reporting. Second, many medical specialists view their CPD requirements as time-consuming, having minimal impact on practice change and improving patient outcomes. There is an opportunity to build new user interfaces based on these data, designed to support individual and group reflection. Data-informed reflective practice has the potential to generate new insights about performance, bridging the gap between CPD and clinical practice.
Objective
This study aims to understand why routinely collected administrative data have not yet become widely used to support reflective practice and lifelong learning.
Methods
We conducted semistructured interviews (N=19) with thought leaders from a range of backgrounds, including clinicians, surgeons, chief medical officers, information and communications technology professionals, informaticians, researchers, and leaders from related industries. Interviews were thematically analyzed by 2 independent coders.
Results
Respondents identified visibility of outcomes, peer comparison, group reflective discussions, and practice change as potential benefits. The key barriers included legacy technology, distrust with data quality, privacy, data misinterpretation, and team culture. Respondents suggested recruiting local champions for co-design, presenting data for understanding rather than information, coaching by specialty group leaders, and timely reflection linked to CPD as enablers to successful implementation.
Conclusions
Overall, there was consensus among thought leaders, bringing together insights from diverse backgrounds and medical jurisdictions. We found that clinicians are interested in repurposing administrative data for professional development despite concerns with underlying data quality, privacy, legacy technology, and visual presentation. They prefer group reflection led by supportive specialty group leaders, rather than individual reflection. Our findings provide novel insights into the specific benefits, barriers, and benefits of potential reflective practice interfaces based on these data sets. They can inform the design of new models of in-hospital reflection linked to the annual CPD planning-recording-reflection cycle.}

Despite the important roles that OLMs play in higher education to support the learning process and self-regulated learning (SRL) in particular, there are few studies systematically reviewing OLM technology in higher education, and investigating their potential to foster self-regulated learning. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners' cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two most-used features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners’ engagement and motivation.}

ePortfolios are increasingly used in health professional clinical education. However, the nature of ePortfolios varies greatly amongst programs, as does the software, purpose, and institutional cost.
Objectives
An integrative review of the literature was conducted to determine how ePortfolios are being used in pre-registration health programs to enhance clinical learning.
Data sources
A systematic search of relevant databases (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Education Resources Information Center, Cochrane, Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Turning Research Into Practice, and Web of Science) was performed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Retrieved papers were assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool and findings were analysed.
Review methods
A total of 272 records were identified. Thirty papers were assessed in detail. Five themes were identified by content analysis; feedback and communication; student-centred learning; experiences and competencies; access, attitudes, and digital literacy; and technological support.
Conclusions
ePortfolios offer a range of pedagogical benefits. Clinical learning is enhanced by student-focused ePortfolio design which includes clear learning outcomes; development of relationships with peers and instructors via ongoing communication and feedback; use of templates; links to time-saving applications; and guided, assessed reflections. Poor technological support, negative attitudes by clinical supervisors, unreliable access, instructor-focused design, and excessive or repetitive documentation in ePortfolio design hindered clinical learning.}

This study explores the effectiveness of a virtual learning assistant in terms of (a) developmental, (b) general compensatory, and (c) differential compensatory effects on learners’ self-regulatory skills in a sample of N = 157 online learners using an experimental intervention-control group design. Methods employed include behavioural trace data as well as self-reporting measures. Participants provided demographic information and responded to a 24-item self-regulation questionnaire and a 20-item personality trait questionnaire. Results indicate that the adaptive assistance did not lead to substantial developmental shifts as captured in learners’ perceived levels of self-regulation. However, various patterns of behavioural changes emerged in response to the intervention. This suggests that the virtual learning assistant has the potential to help online learners effectively compensate for deficits (in contrast to developmental shifts) in self-regulatory skills that might not yet have been developed.}

abstract = {Feedback is an essential component of scaffolding for learning. Feedback provides insights into the assistance of learners in terms of achieving learning goals and improving self-regulated skills. In online courses, feedback becomes even more critical since instructors and students are separated geographically and physically. In this context, feedback allows the instructor to customize learning content according to the students' needs. However, giving feedback is a challenging task for instructors, especially in contexts of large cohorts. As a result, several automatic feedback systems have been proposed to reduce the workload on the part of the instructor. Although these systems have started gaining research attention, there have been limited studies that systematically analyze the progress achieved so far as reported in the literature. Thus, this article presents a systematic literature review on automatic feedback generation in learning management systems. The main findings of this review are: (1) 65.07% of the studies demonstrate that automatic feedback increases student performance in activities; (2) 46.03% of the studies demonstrated that there is no evidence that automatic feedback eases instructors’ workload; (3) 82.53% of the studies showed that there is no evidence that manual feedback is more efficient than automatic feedback; and (4) the main method used for automatic feedback provision is the comparison with a desired answer in some subject (such as logic circuits or programming).}

This research introduces a Smart Health Monitoring System (SHMS) that enables real-time patient health tracking and environmental monitoring using IoT and machine learning (ML). The primary goal of the system is to provide continuous and remote monitoring of vital signs, including Body Temperature (BT), Heart Rate (HR), Environmental Temperature (ET), and Environmental Humidity (EH). Sensor-based data acquisition is managed through microcontroller hardware, with data transmitted via Wi-Fi to cloud-based platforms accessible through smartphones, laptops, and other internet-enabled devices. The system processes data using machine learning models—Logistic Regression and Decision Tree—to predict the patient’s health status with high accuracy. Results indicate that the Logistic Regression model outperforms the Decision Tree model, achieving an accuracy rate of 88.89 %. Additionally, the SHMS architecture is scalable, supporting multi-user environments and large numbers of connected devices, making it suitable for real-world healthcare deployment. To enhance pandemic responsiveness, the system can be extended to measure additional parameters such as Respiratory Rate (RR) and Oxygen Saturation (SpO₂), which are essential during outbreaks of respiratory diseases like COVID-19 and influenza. This solution offers an effective and accessible tool for early detection, timely intervention, and reduced burden on healthcare infrastructure, especially during health crises.}

The increasing adoption of CMS for online and mixed-learning environments highlights their importance. However, inherent limitations in conventional CMS platforms hinder personalized student guidance and effective identification of academic challenges. Addressing this crucial gap, our study introduces an AI Student Success Predictor empowered by advanced machine learning algorithms, capable of automating grading processes, predicting student risks, and forecasting retention or dropout outcomes. Central to our approach is the creation of a standardized dataset, meticulously curated by integrating student information from diverse relational databases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature learning block is developed the extract the hidden patterns in the student data. This classification model stands as an ensemble masterpiece, incorporating SVM, Random Forest, and KNN classifiers, subsequently refined by a Bayesian averaging model. The proposed ensemble model shows the ability to predict the student grades, retention, and risk levels of dropout. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model is assessed using test data, culminating in a commendable 93% accuracy for student grade prediction and student risk prediction, and a solid 92% accuracy for the complex domain of retention and dropout forecasting. The proposed AI system seamlessly integrates with existing CMS infrastructure, enabling real-time data retrieval and swift, accurate predictions, enhancing academic decision-making efficiency. Our study's pioneering AI Student Success Predictor bridges the chasm between traditional CMS limitations and the growing demands of modern education.}

The results showed that the high SDL ability students demonstrated significantly more reading engagement, SDL behaviors, motivation and autonomy for extensive reading than those with low SDL ability. These findings suggested that an SDL support environment could be exploited as a useful tool to support foreign language learning in the schools; however, the affective and behavioral outcomes created by the environment were affected to varying degrees by the levels of students’ SDL ability. The study provided implications for researchers studying extensive reading and SDL environments, as well as for educators seeking to improve extensive reading with SDL strategy usage.}

Sixty-six participants were recruited to evaluate the quality of given scientific explanations while self-reporting their interpreting and reasoning processes. The self-reported protocols were further coded and categorized as cognitive or metacognitive activities for training and evaluating an AI model. Long Short-Term Memory, an AI classifier, was employed to predict the rich narrative texts expressed by learners on using strategies in complex science tasks. Quantitative analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the classifier. Results suggested promising accuracy/consistency between human-based and the AI classifier. In addition, two design factors, AI structure and dropout rate, did not significantly impact the performance. Qualitative examinations of discrepancies between human and AI classifier revealed that length of segments and segments including a phrase or words with temporal cues could potentially influence the accuracy of AI judgments. Overall, The AI classifier yielded a fair performance demonstrating acceptable accuracy in the prediction of cognitive or metacognitive strategies with a limited dataset for a total of merely 104 protocols from 66 participants. Our qualitative observations that attempt to explain sources of human-computer discrepancies may shed light on future improvement for AI-based methods.

abstract = {Background
Data quality is vital for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and validity of survey findings. Strategies for ensuring survey data quality have traditionally used quality assurance procedures. Data analytics is an increasingly vital part of survey quality assurance, particularly in light of the increasing use of tablets and other electronic tools, which enable rapid, if not real-time, data access. Routine data analytics are most often concerned with outlier analyses that monitor a series of data quality indicators, including response rates, missing data, and reliability of coefficients for test-retest interviews. Machine learning is emerging as a possible tool for enhancing real-time data monitoring by identifying trends in the data collection, which could compromise quality.
Objective
This study aimed to describe methods for the quality assessment of a household survey using both traditional methods as well as machine learning analytics.
Methods
In the Kilkari impact evaluation’s end-line survey amongst postpartum women (n=5095) in Madhya Pradesh, India, we plan to use both traditional and machine learning–based quality assurance procedures to improve the quality of survey data captured on maternal and child health knowledge, care-seeking, and practices. The quality assurance strategy aims to identify biases and other impediments to data quality and includes seven main components: (1) tool development, (2) enumerator recruitment and training, (3) field coordination, (4) field monitoring, (5) data analytics, (6) feedback loops for decision making, and (7) outcomes assessment. Analyses will include basic descriptive and outlier analyses using machine learning algorithms, which will involve creating features from time-stamps, “don’t know” rates, and skip rates. We will also obtain labeled data from self-filled surveys, and build models using k-folds cross-validation on a training data set using both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. Based on these models, results will be fed back to the field through various feedback loops.
Results
Data collection began in late October 2019 and will span through March 2020. We expect to submit quality assurance results by August 2020.
Conclusions
Machine learning is underutilized as a tool to improve survey data quality in low resource settings. Study findings are anticipated to improve the overall quality of Kilkari survey data and, in turn, enhance the robustness of the impact evaluation. More broadly, the proposed quality assurance approach has implications for data capture applications used for special surveys as well as in the routine collection of health information by health workers.

abstract = {Reflection is a key activity in self-regulated learning (SRL) and a critical part of health professions education that supports the development of effective lifelong-learning health professionals. Despite widespread use and plentiful theoretical models, empirical understanding of and support for reflection in health professions education remains limited due to simple manual assessment and rare feedback to students. Recent moves to digital reflection practices offer opportunities to computationally study and support reflection as a part of SRL. The critical task in such an endeavor, and the goal of this paper, is to align high-level reflection qualities that are valued conceptually with low-level features in the data that are possible to extract computationally. This paper approaches this goal by (a) developing a unified framework for conceptualizing reflection analytics in health professions education and (b) empirically examining potential data features through which these elements can be assessed. Synthesizing the prior literature yields a conceptual framework for health professions reflection comprised of six elements: Description, Analysis, Feelings, Perspective, Evaluation, and Outcome. These elements then serve as the conceptual grounding for the computational analysis in which 27 dental students’ reflections (in six reflective statement types) over the course of 4 years were examined using selected LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) indices. Variation in elements of reflection across students, years, and reflection-types supports use of the multi-dimensional analysis framework to (a) increase precision of research claims; (b) evaluate whether reflection activities are engaged in as intended; and (c) diagnose aspects of reflection in which specific students need support. Implications for the development of health professions reflection analytics that can contribute to SRL and promising areas for future research are discussed.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a theory-driven trigger regulation framework for advancing multimodal analytical approaches to research about self-regulated learning. Events and/or situations that may inhibit learning processes and, thus, require regulatory responses are defined as trigger events. Empirically identifying trigger signals in multimodal data as markers for the regulation of cognition, motivation, emotion, and behavior has great potential for advancing the field. We propose a trigger regulation framework and explain how it can be leveraged in multimodal research for detecting trigger signals focusing analysis on meaningful regulatory responses. This conceptual framework offers potential to guide methodological and analytical advances in research to examine the situated nature of regulatory responses and within-person individual differences in SRL as they play out during complex task work and teamwork.
Educational relevance and implications statement
The trigger regulation framework contributes to advancing multimodal approaches to the study of SRL. It presents a theory driven analytical approach for detecting, modeling, and interpreting adaptive and maladaptive regulation during individual or collaborative work. Grounding analytical approaches to multimodal data analysis in this framework has potential to increase the quality and accuracy of research findings and interpretations and inform the development of interventions and AI systems.}

Educators often find themselves in possession of large amounts of text-based materials, such as student reflections, narrative feedback, and assignments. While these materials can provide critical insight into topics of interest, they also require a substantial amount of time to read, interpret, and use. The purpose of this article is to describe and provide recommendations for text analytics.
Methodological literature review
An overview of text analytics is provided, including a brief history, common types of contemporary techniques, and the basic phases of text analytics. Several examples of common text analytics techniques are used to illustrate this approach.
Our recommendations and their applications
Practical recommendations are provided to support the use of text analytics in pharmacy education. These recommendations include: (1) clarify the purpose of the text analytics; (2) ensure the research questions are relevant and grounded in the literature; (3) develop a processing strategy and create a dictionary; (4) explore various tools for analysis and visualization; (5) establish tolerance for error; (6) train, calibrate, and validate the analytic strategy; and (7) collaborate and equip yourself.
Potential impact
Text analytics provide a systematic approach to generating information from text-based materials. Several benefits to this approach are apparent, such as improving the efficiency of analyzing text and elucidating new knowledge. Despite recent developments in text analytics techniques, limitations to this approach remain. Efforts to improve usability and accessibility of text analytics remain ongoing, and pharmacy educators should position their work within the context of these limitations.}

abstract = {Flipped classroom (FC) is an active learning design requiring students to complete assigned pre-class learning activities in preparation for face-to-face sessions. Students' timely, regular, and productive engagement with the pre-class activities is considered critical for the success of the overall FC design, as these activities serve to prepare students for effective participation in face-to-face sessions. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the strength of association between students' regularity of engagement with the pre-class activities and their learning performance in a FC course. Hence, the current study uses learning trace data from three consecutive offerings of a FC course to examine students' regularity of pre-class learning activities and its association with the students' course performance. In particular, the study derives several indicators of regularity from the trace data, including indicators related to time management and those reflecting regularity in the pattern of engagement with pre-class learning activities. The association with course performance is examined by building predictive regression models with the defined indicators as features. To examine the relevance of incorporating the specificities of the instructional design in predictive models, we designed and compared two kinds of indicators: generic (i.e. course-design-agnostic) and course-design-specific indicators. The study identified several indicators of regularity of pre-class activities as significant predictors of course performance. It also demonstrated that predictive models with only generic indicators were able to explain only a small portion of the overall variability in the students' course performance, and were significantly outperformed by models that incorporated coursespecific indicators. Finally, the study findings point to the importance of assisting students in regulating their use of learning resources during class preparation activities in a FC.}

The study aimed to characterize learners according to their learning patterns and to identify indicators that predict students' success in an online environment. Specifically, we focused on the role of a central factor affecting success in online courses: self-regulated learning and learner engagement. To this end, we used a mixed methods approach that combines semi-structured interviews and statistical analysis. We applied two logistic regression models and a decision tree algorithm and found two parameters that can predict completion of the course: the submission status of an optional assignment and the students' cumulative video opening pattern (SCOP). Recommendations for institutions and lecturers regarding the benefits of implementing these models to identify self-regulated learning patterns in online courses and to design future effective interventions are discussed. Regarding students, we emphasize the importance of time management and how choices they make with respect to their learning process affect their potential for success.}

However, these high-dimensional time-varying student performance data involve multiple associated subjects, such as student, course, and teacher, which exhibit complex interrelationships in academic semesters, knowledge categories, and student groups. This makes it challenging to conduct a comprehensive analysis of association patterns. To this end, we construct a visual analysis framework, called MAPVis, to support multi-method and multi-level interactive exploration of the association patterns in student performance. MAPVis consists of two stages: in the first stage, we extract students’ learning patterns and further introduce mutual information to explore the distribution of learning patterns; in the second stage, various learning patterns and subject attributes are integrated based on a hierarchical apriori algorithm to achieve a multi-subject interactive exploration of the association patterns among students, courses, and teachers. Finally, we conduct a case study using real student performance data to verify the applicability and effectiveness of MAPVis.}

Three-level random-effects meta-analyses revealed significant relationships between SRL strategies and achievement motivation (r = .30), learning performance (r = .36), learner engagement (r = .39), learner satisfaction (r = .30), avoidance behavior (r = −.14), prior knowledge (r = .05), CE experience (r = .08), organizational learning culture (r = .26), job control (r = .28), and job demands (r = .21). Operationalization of variables as well as setting and work-relatedness of the CE activity were identified as moderators. Our investigations help understand the nature of SRL in CE and provide a sound basis for designing interventions to support SRL in CE. Future research should identify moderators to explain heterogeneity in effect sizes.}

An online survey, where participants were sent one of three different cases (Case A related to first-generation students, Case B, an archetypical student, Case C, students with a learning disability), and 18 identical questions across all three cases. The survey was distributed among 1773 teachers. Based on the responses of 194 university teachers, we identify differences related to responsibility, equity, and knowledge about artificial intelligence. Our quantitative data exhibited that in Case A and Case C, the respondents ranked to a higher degree that universities should use artificial intelligence tools and systems to achieve equitable outcomes. Data revealed no statistically significant associations among the respondents with regard to background variables in Case A. However, Case B and Case C disclosed statistically significant associations concerning gender, age, faculty, and academic position among the participants. Moreover, we identify teachers’ fears and scepticism about artificial intelligence in higher education, concerns about fairness and responsibility, and lack of knowledge about artificial intelligence and resources to engage with artificial intelligence in teaching practices.}

AI has the potential to educate, train, and improve the performance of humans, making them better at their tasks and activities. The use of AI can enhance human welfare in numerous respects, such as through improving the productivity of food, health, water, education, and energy services. However, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in employment, gender, and racial inequality. We envision that AI can evolve into human-centered AI (HAI), which refers to approaching AI from a human perspective by considering human conditions and contexts. Most current discussions on AI technology focus on how AI can enable human performance. However, we explore AI can also inhibit the human condition and advocate for an in-depth dialog between technology- and humanity-based researchers to improve understanding of HAI from various perspectives.}

abstract = {The Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework has been widely used in online teaching in higher education over the past twenty years. Its goal is to support students' professional development while fostering their critical thinking. In this paper, we thematically analyze how the framework authors' interpretations of critical thinking translate into the construct of cognitive presence—operationalized in the Practical inquiry model—and its commonly used coding scheme(s). We show that the framework suffers from having become a “pragmatic” tool, thus compromising the intended dimension of fostering critical thinking. Furthermore, we draw attention to the “acting” role of coding schemes, which may have consequences for research and teaching practice. In a first step, we examine the theoretical assumptions based on Lipman's and Garrison and Archer's ideas about the target category of critical thinking incorporated in the CoI framework. Although the framework is informed by a community of inquiry in Lipman's sense, we show that the chief characteristic of critical thinking associated with facilitating good judgment is not sufficiently addressed. Critical thinking is conceptualized more as confirmation of knowledge structures and problem-solving thinking within the Practical Inquiry model. In a second step, we systematically analyze cognitive presence coding schemes as research tools for capturing critical thinking. We trace a narrowing view of critical thinking within the CoI framework and regarding the coding schemes that measure cognitive presence. Consequently, we raise awareness of the risks in educational research arising from the complexity-reducing modeling and operationalizing of multifaceted educational concerns, such as critical thinking in a community of inquiry.}

abstract = {The use of small-scale biodigesters is gaining traction in Kenya and Uganda as a clean renewable energy solution. In this paper, we explore how remote monitoring through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can enhance the service quality of biogas digesters in low-resource settings and promote transparency in carbon accounting. Using data from 121 monitored digesters in Uganda and Kenya, we demonstrate how the analysis of real-time pressure and flow data, coupled with machine learning, can provide an understanding of usage patterns, provide behavioural insights, facilitate the early identification of issues requiring intervention, and give insights into relative digester performance. The tools presented offer a powerful means to study behavioural patterns and the adoption dynamics of biogas as a clean cooking fuel, aligning with national and global aims of broader clean cooking interventions.}

However, the students' reactions to such techno-pedagogical innovations are much less explored in settings beyond the development and testing. This paper analyses the students' acceptance of an early warning system developed at a fully online university. Following a pre-usage and post-usage experimental design based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model and the Structural Equation Modelling, we observed how, within four courses (839 participants in the academic year 2019–20, of which 347 participants answered both a pre- and post-usage questionnaire), the students' acceptance changed overtime. Our findings revealed a disconfirmation effect in the acceptance of the early warning system, namely, a difference between expectations surrounding the technology pre- and post-usage, and shed light on the ways artificial intelligence systems should be integrated within Higher Education virtual classrooms.}

Considerable studies explore the necessary integrated learning perspectives, emphasizing AI's adaptive role as a mind tool. In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.}

abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) can be defined as the ability of learners to act independently and actively manage their own learning process. This skill becomes especially important in online environments, which allow learners to decide where and how to study. Most research on SRL has focused on students; few studies have addressed teachers' SRL as learners, and only a handful has done so in the context of online learning. A better understanding of teachers' SRL is essential since teachers are expected to support the development of their students' SRL abilities. This study contributes to bridging this gap by examining how online learning patterns reflect the self-regulated learning of teachers as learners in an online professional development (PD) course on nanotechnology. The study applies a mixed methods approach that combines the qualitative analysis of interviews with teacher learners and a personal summary of their learning process represented in four vignettes as well as quantitative log-file analysis to identify teachers' learning patterns. The patterns identified are interval learning, on-track learning, skipping difficult parts, concentrated learning toward the end of the course (i.e., “bingeing”), and watching together. These patterns indirectly shed light on teachers' SRL skills, especially their time management and task strategies, demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to learning. The study highlights the need for a holistic approach, provides deeper insights into teachers’ learning experiences, and helps design future online PD courses.}

Using Empatica E4 wristbands, electrodermal activity—to derive arousal—was measured in 24 high school students working in groups of three (i.e., triads) during two runs of an advanced physics course. The participants met three times a week over six weeks for lessons of 75 min each. Most of the time (≈60–95% of the lesson) the triad members were at different arousal levels, and, when they were on the same level, it was mainly the low arousal (or deactivated) level. Less than 4% of the time were the triad members simultaneously in high arousal. Possible within-triad arousal contagion cases (71.3%) occurred mostly on a one-to-one basis and with a latency from within a few seconds up to 10 min, but usually within 1 min. This study supports the view that only small parts of group work are collaborative, as far as the synchronicity and coordination which collaboration presupposes. Although exploratory, results also illustrate the affordances of physiological measures to characterize collaborative processes.}

This has led to an increasing interest on the use of games for non-entertainment purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In particular, SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide reliable assessments, but also because they can measure competences that would be difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However, one of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable GBAs by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the GBA area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach can be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm that the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along with the metrics replicated and designed in the system. We expect our work to solve the current limitations regarding GBA interoperability, thus allowing the deployment of Game-Based Assessments as a Service (GBAaaS).}

Next, support vector machines identified misclassified lesson plans. Finally, we used ordinal logistic regression to estimate Betas for each predictor. The strongest classifiers were sentiment analysis scores and word counts. The model was fairly accurate, yielding a 12.82%, a 7.69%, and a 23.08% misclassification rate.

abstract = {As smart environments move from a research vision to concrete manifestations in real-world enabled by the Internet of Things, they are encountering a number of very practical challenges in data management in terms of the flexibility needed to bring together contextual and real-time data, the interface between new digital infrastructures and existing information systems, and how to easily share data between stakeholders in the environment. Therefore, data management approaches for smart environments need to support flexibility, dynamicity, incremental change, while keeping costs to a minimum. A Dataspace is an emerging approach to data management that has proved fruitful for personal information and scientific data management. However, their use within smart environments and for real-time data remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a Real-time Linked Dataspace (RLD) as an enabling platform for data management within smart environments. This paper identifies common data management requirements for smart energy and water environments, details the RLD architecture and the key support services and their tiered support levels, and a principled approach to “Pay-As-You-Go” data management. The paper presents a dataspace query service for real-time data streams and entities to enable unified entity-centric queries across live and historical stream data. The RLD was validated in 5 real-world pilot smart environments following the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop to build real-time analytics, decisions support, and smart apps for energy and water management. The pilots demonstrate that the RLD enables incremental pay-as-you-go data management with support services that simplify the development of applications and analytics for smart environments. Finally, the paper discusses experiences, lessons learnt, and future directions.}

But it also entails recruiting new employees, as well as re- and upskilling current employees of diverse ages groups for new and increasingly more complex tasks to manage increasingly more complex information. In this article we present an overview and meta perspective on serious games as a human-centric methodology. We discuss how these can contribute to 1) learning how operators react to complex situations and how they deal with incomplete, uncertain, or fuzzy information, 2) understanding how operators of production systems and production networks can be supported by human-centric industrial user interfaces, and 3) enable operators to act appropriately in complex and dynamic cyber-physical production systems. We present an actionable adaptable iterative process model for designing serious games and exemplify this model using a supply chain and quality management serious game. Further, we present empirical studies that illustrate the application of the model and suggest the utility of serious games as a learning environment, to evaluate industrial user interfaces, and to investigate human behavior in complex production environments. As such, we propose serious games as a versatile methodology to facilitate transitioning from Industry 4.0 (data-driven and interconnected) to Industry 5.0 (humane work and sustainability).}

abstract = {With the rapid development of information technology, intelligent recommendation system has become an indispensable part of people's daily life. It has not only greatly enhanced the technological experience, but also caused people to pay more and more attention to their surroundings. This paper first introduces an algorithm based on intelligent recommendation, which plays a key role in the process of web browsing; then, this paper designs an advertising recognition model through the study of feature extraction methods and combined with advertising, aiming to solve the above problems, and verifies the accuracy and practicability of the model to help improve the overall performance of the website, so as to maximize the value utilization rate of the intelligent recommendation system in the sales promotion work of merchants. The verification results show that the processing time of advertising recognition fluctuates sharply throughout the period, sometimes increasing rapidly and sometimes decreasing rapidly. The reason for this fluctuation may be caused by different amounts of advertising and data. At the fourth point in time, the processing time for AD recognition peaked at 6 seconds, indicating that the system needed to process more ads at that point in time. At 6:00, the processing time for AD recognition quickly drops to just 3 seconds, which means that the system is processing a smaller number of ads at this point in time.}

Likewise, cities are interested in improving responsiveness to citizens’ demands and cost savings through data analytics. However, city managers face many challenges when utilizing secondary data, such as 311 call records and the US Census. The challenge of interest to the current study is boundary issues as a result of data being collected at divergent geographic levels over different time horizons. Accordingly, an inductive analytical methodology was developed to create units of analysis that were both pragmatically and analytically appropriate for city managers and local policymakers. We created an open data analytics framework called OpenComm to harmonize administrative and secondary data using administrative data derived from Kansas City, Missouri. This framework produced robust inferences regarding the spatial and temporal aspects for the communities. Privacy-preserving technology, in particular, has been applied to public data to protect community privacy. The findings illustrate the power of inductive data aggregation, leading to empirical insights into hidden patterns of city service disparity over a decade-long time horizon.

This study addresses this challenge by developing a computerized program for middle school mathematics teachers that provides frequent opportunities for teachers to interact with and obtain personalized and real-time feedback from a virtual facilitator based on natural language processing. Based on the data collected from 1727 middle school students in an experiment in which the teachers of these students were randomly assigned to the program or the business-as-usual condition (i.e., the control group), we found that the program had a statistically significant impact on students’ mathematics performance. These results demonstrate the potential of incorporating an automated, interactive feedback tool supported by artificial intelligence to create effective, scalable teacher PD.}

Our analyses revealed that perceived difficulties in comprehension and meaningful structural breakpoints in the videos were associated with increased pausing behavior. In contrast, pausing behavior was not associated with the videos’ formal structural features highlighted in the video platform. Implications of these findings and the potentials of our methodological approach for theory and practice are discussed.}

Students in classes that used the target program scored significantly higher at posttest on a standardized literacy assessment than students in control classes. Effects were comparable for both White and African-American/Black students. Students with greater aptitude for decoding/word-level skills (operationalized by starting the program in higher “Word Study” levels and completing more levels in fewer weeks) earned higher posttest scores.

Previous studies suggested the positive effects of including students' voices in technological and instructional design. However, educators usually cannot revise the features of SNT as they like, which may limit the possibility of enhancing students' engagement (i.e., cognitive, emotional, and social-behavioral engagement). Therefore, this study explored whether changing SNT technological and instructional design based on students' voices can improve engagement. We developed a photo-sharing web-based SNT and examined whether refining the SNT and instruction design based on students' input would enhance their multifaceted engagement in a learning community. We collected the opinions and feedback from 114 undergraduate students in an environmental psychology course at a private university in the USA using surveys every three weeks. We refined the technological and instructional design accordingly. Students' engagement was measured four times during the semester, and after the semester, nine students were interviewed with regard to how the technological and instructional design changes influenced their engagement. With successive iterations, we found that students' cognitive and emotional engagement significantly improved, while their social-behavioral engagement did not change significantly during the study. Interview results further explained how the design changes influenced students' engagement. The findings suggested soliciting students’ input into SNT technological and instructional design can benefit their engagement in a learning community, while engagement was also influenced by many other factors.}

abstract = {The goal of this study is to introduce and evaluate a novel online simulation method built upon buyer-seller roleplay in a private social network for housing economics education. This is at a time when classroom disruptions due to COVID-19 require new methods to engage with students asynchronously. While methods like game-based learning simulations show potential to engage, they are often high-fidelity and require high setup costs. This is also the case for existing housing simulation games, for which besides being single player mode, costs for technical customization and learning curve reduces adoption in the classroom. In this context, the use of social networks to facilitate a low-fidelity buyer-seller housing roleplay may provide flexible learning goals and peer engagement, but its implementation is unclear. This gap in knowledge has motivated this investigation, for which undergraduate students in Hong Kong participated in property buyer-seller roleplay. Students posted available property and buyers bid for them using comments on a private social media app, Soqqle. Post-course reflective essays suggest that various student needs were met, indicating that the setup supports flexible learning outcomes. Authentic learning outcomes like knowledge transfer, reflection, challenge, and realism were also experienced. Further, although statistically insignificant due to lack of observations, a regression analysis shows that experiencing and overcoming challenges (β = 3.996, p = .082) provides the biggest learning outcome (R2 = 0.325). A focus group with other simulation practitioners suggests the benefits of this method could extend to them. The findings of this study can benefit practitioners of game-based learning looking for quick and easy methods to introduce online roleplay for real-life scenarios in their classes.}

This study postulates that it is essential that future retail electricity markets are designed by cross-linking current analytical approaches and integrating proprietary and open-source modelling tools, by adopting the latest development frameworks across data science, software development, cloud computing and Internet of Things interconnectivity. Current analytical methods applicable for retail electricity market design are reviewed and multi-criteria decision analyses are applied to assess modelling tool and development framework effectiveness. A key finding of this study is that current analytical methods applied in the research domain are typically segregated or siloed. As current analytical methods tend to focus on specific clusters, such as electricity customer profiling, demand response and dynamic pricing, peer-to-peer electricity trading, interconnectivity of Internet of Things devices and distribution-level power dynamics, rather than the integration of these clusters and how each analytical method interacts with each other. Similarly, this study finds that modelling tools are also typically segregated or siloed, focusing on energy system planning, electricity market simulation, power system simulation and energy consumption analysis. To provide the necessary tools to design future retail electricity markets, this study suggests that robust modelling tool integration is required.}

However, search & select in large OER repositories can be a daunting task for teachers. Incorporating peer recommendations, as is common in online marketplaces, is becoming a popular solution that seeks to exploit the wisdom of the crowd for this task. However, teachers are often reluctant to take a contributory role and provide social recommendations. In addition, little is known about the actual value of social recommendations as a search aid. In this research, we implemented a “light-weight” socially-based recommender system (RS) within a large OER repository that includes social network features. We examined two aspects of the socially-based recommendation mechanisms. First, their utility as search aids that assist teachers in searching and selecting suitable LRs, and second, their impact on teachers' incentives to share recommendations that can assist fellow teachers. To study these two aspects, we examined two science teacher communities using this repository. The results demonstrated the incentivising power of social rewards, and the value of social recommendations as means for search & select. However, we also observed a heterogeneous effect of social features on teachers' behaviour. To explore the factors that may explain these differences, we employed a mixed-method approach, combining qualitative, quantitative, and Social Network Analysis methods. Triangulation of the findings underline the relation between the strength of the social ties within the teachers’ community and the effectiveness of socially-based features.}

This paper reports on a systematic literature review of small groups in technology-mediated learning settings to explore the definitions of cohesion and the methodologies used for the measurements that have been identified arising in this area. Furthermore, the review provides a characterisation of the factors that impact collaborative learning in computer-supported environments, highlighting two important aspects: i) there is a significant gap in measuring cohesion using unobtrusive methods, such as relying on log or trace data and ii) there is a lack of longitudinal approaches to understand the emergence of cohesion. Finally, we discuss implications for future research in studying group cohesion.}

However, conventional approaches to infrastructure planning and investment decision-making have predominantly focused on maximizing economic efficiency and investment returns, often overlooking the broader impact on diverse regions and social groups. This study delves into the intricate relationship between socio-economic disparity and infrastructure investment within US cities. Using the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and municipality-level data on infrastructure expenditure from the Census, we investigate both spatial and temporal variations in social vulnerability and infrastructure expenditure on public health, housing, water and sewerage, and transportation. Using advanced statistical analysis rooted in deep learning, we also estimate the potential implications of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act on socio-economic equity. Our findings reveal a compelling narrative: a shift from an equality focused to an equity-driven allocation of infrastructure expenditure among municipalities engenders an enhancement in socio-economic performance. These findings highlight the need to incorporate equity into the impact appraisal framework to support equitable infrastructure planning and investment decision-making.}

abstract = {Mobile internet, cloud computing, big data technologies, and significant breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have all transformed education. In recent years, there has been an emergence of more advanced AI-enabled learning systems, which are gaining traction due to their ability to deliver learning content and adapt to the individual needs of students. Yet, even though these contemporary learning systems are useful educational platforms that meet students’ needs, there is still a low number of implemented systems designed to address the concerns and problems faced by many students. Based on this perspective, a systematic mapping of the literature on AI-enabled adaptive learning systems was performed in this work. A total of 147 studies published between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. The major findings and contributions of this paper include the identification of the types of AI-enabled learning interventions used, a visualisation of the co-occurrences of authors associated with major research themes in AI-enabled learning systems and a review of common analytical methods and related techniques utilised in such learning systems. This mapping can serve as a guide for future studies on how to better design AI-enabled learning systems to solve specific learning problems and improve users’ learning experiences.}

However, there is limited prior research investigating how to facilitate such integrated STEM learning in formal classrooms that go beyond a simple combination of the different subject areas and instead enable teaching and learning of disciplinary concepts infused with scientific inquiry, engineering design, mathematical reasoning, and 21st century technological skills. In this paper, we investigate the affordances of using an educational Computer Aided Design tool, Energy 3D, and corresponding curricular materials to support such integrated STEM learning anchored in the engineering design process. We present an exploratory case study that was conducted in a middle school in the US, where a project-based learning approach was followed and students were asked to design a low-cost energy-efficient home within a given budget using the Energy3D CAD tool. Findings indicate that students learned to engage in the design process and demonstrated practices of idea fluency and systematic experimentation; practices usually representative of informed designers. During the design process while analyzing the problem space, generating ideas, and evaluating solutions, they developed better understanding of the relationships between variables and underlying science concepts, used various mathematical analysis tools and graphical representations embedded in the available technology to inform their engineering design decisions. The learning environment using Energy3D afforded formative feedback to help students understand relationship between variables, provided converging evidences using multiple analytical tools, and enabled visual problem decomposition using suboptimal model to engage students in integrated STEM learning. This study provides a platform for future research investigating the effectiveness of educational CAD tools and curricular scaffolds designed specifically for K-12 students for supporting integrated STEM learning anchored in the design process.}

The study presents a system architecture that includes integrated data, data preprocessing, model design and training Long-Short Term Memory with Attention Mechanism (LSTM-AM), and cloud-based validation. It draws on a synthesized dataset of 5000 hospital user profiles. Rigorous training and validation confirm the system's outstanding efficiency, resulting in 99.06% accuracy, 98.14% precision, 99.06% recall, and a 99.00% F1 score. Consequently, this demonstrates that the approach handles healthcare data safely and confidentially. There is a considerable improvement in sequential data processing when LSTM-AM is used and cloud validation is utilized to maintain data integrity. This work introduces an innovative strategy to integrate IoT and ML in healthcare, addressing security and privacy concerns and potentially revolutionizing patient care and administration. The study will assist physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of patient diseases securely, privately and more accurately.}

New learning objects are usually assessed when students actually use the materials. To improve quality assurance in the design of learning objects, this paper proposes systemically analyzing the user experience of new learning objects. This involves not only considering student feedback, but also integrating other perspectives into a continuous feedback loop, through a participatory design approach. The proposed framework was tested during the implementation of a flipped classroom initiative in a large Chilean university over a period of six months, involving 6 content designers, 3 teachers, 2 teaching assistants and 98 students. We observe how elements of feedback are integrated through a systemic assessment, where the end result (the learning object) is contrasted with the elements that guided its creation (the design guidelines). In this way, the roles of designer and user are complemented so as to identify design gaps early on in the process of creating a solution. This study adds to the current literature by relating design guidelines with the principles of instruction during the design process in order to ensure the overall quality of the learning objects.}

Previous research using self-report or laboratory measures of reading show that engagement with the textbook was related to student learning outcomes. We hypothesized that an engagement index based on digital textbook usage data would predict student course grades. Linear regression analyses were conducted using data from 233 students to determine whether digital textbook usage metrics predicted final course grades. A calculated linear index of textbook usage metrics was significantly predictive of final course grades and was a stronger predictor of course outcomes than previous academic achievement. However, time spent reading, one of the variables that make up the index was more strongly predictive of course outcomes. Additionally, students who were in the top 10th percentile in number of highlights had significantly higher course grades than those in the lower 90th percentile. These findings suggest that digital textbook analytics are an effective early warning system to identify students at risk of academic failure. These data can be collected unobtrusively and automatically and provide stronger prediction of outcomes than prior academic achievement (which to this point has been the single strongest predictor of student success).}

Historically, since the emergence of AI, its influence, functions, and applications have been transcending from one form to another in the sequence of artificial intelligence (simple level of AI) to applied artificial intelligence, to machine learning, and to deep learning. From our study outcome, numerous scholars predicted that AI and ML will continue to transform beyond their current state to more sophisticated tools. A bibliometric analysis was performed with the extracted articles on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and education pedagogy from the Scopus database. The downloaded data were analyzed with bibliometrics research tools such as VOSviewer (Var 1.6.6) and R packages. For this study exploration, a total of one thousand, one hundred and thirty-eight (1138) documents were authored by two thousand, eight hundred (2800) researchers and published in six-hundred and thirty-five (635) journals from 2000 to 2021, with 5.984 as the average citations per document from sixty-two (62) countries.

The final product goes through extensive research and development to meet the target product profile and to obtain a product that is manufacturable at scale. Historically, this process often feels inflexible and linear, as ideas and development paths are eliminated early on to allow focus on the workstream with the highest probability of success. Carrying multiple options early in development is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Similarly, changing development pathways after significant investment carries a high “penalty of change” (PoC), which makes pivoting to a new concept late in development inhibitory. Can drug product (DP) development be made more flexible? The authors believe that combining a nonlinear DP development approach, leveraging state-of-the art data sciences, and using emerging process and measurement technologies will offer enhanced flexibility and should become the new normal. Through the use of iterative DP evaluation, “smart” clinical studies, artificial intelligence, novel characterization techniques, automation, and data collection/modeling/interpretation, it should be possible to significantly reduce the PoC during development. In this Perspective, a review of ideas/techniques along with supporting technologies that can be applied at each stage of DP development is shared. It is further discussed how these contribute to an improved and flexible DP development through the acceleration of the iterative build–measure–learn cycle in laboratories and clinical trials.}

Interventional research in pharmacy education includes the study of complex challenges that can be difficult to navigate. Design-based research (DBR), is a systematic and iterative approach to interventional research that is attentive to the practical and theoretical contributions to education. Practical contributions include the creation of novel solutions to complex problems that improve learning while theoretical contributions include refining our understanding of context-specific learning. In this paper, we describe how we addressed challenges associated with student collaboration in pharmacy education by applying DBR to bridge theory and practice.
Methodological literature review
DBR is characterized as authentic, contextually aware, collaborative, theoretically focused, methodologically diverse, practical, iterative, and operation-oriented. DBR includes three iterative phases: (1) analysis and exploration, (2) design and construction, and (3) evaluation and reflection.
Our recommendations and their applications
To integrate DBR into interventional research, scholars should work collaboratively with diverse teams of experts. DBR also requires extensive planning, a toolkit of expansive research methodologies, and attention to practical and theoretical considerations. Finally, scholars should share their work as often as possible and engage in creative exercises to promote innovative solutions to challenges in education.
Potential impact
DBR offers an approach to generate practical, theoretical, and scholarly contributions to pharmacy education research. In summary, DBR can aid pharmacy educational scholars by using a flexible, iterative, and systematic process to generate novel and creative solutions to complex problems.}

However, students report difficulties sustaining their engagement because of the self-paced nature of OER-supported learning environments. We noted that little attention has been paid to factors related to student perseverance and attrition in the learning environment. Little knowledge about these factors prevents discussion on how to promote OERs as pedagogical tools that complement the formal school curriculum. To address this research gap, we analyzed student- and teacher-level usage data, and demographic information. The purpose was to explore student- and teacher-level factors associated with the duration of student usage in Algebra Nation, an OER-supported online learning platform adopted in many secondary schools. The results revealed that at the student level, student engagement with video lectures, self-assessment, social tools, and additional videos relevant to solved test items significantly predicted student usage duration. At the teacher level, teachers’ use of teacher resources was positively associated with student usage duration. An additional analysis of student and teacher total usage time indicated that, compared with heavy users, light and medium users were more likely to discontinue their engagement in the long term if their teachers did not use the platform. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for promoting student engagement with OER-supported online learning in secondary education contexts.}

The platform’s main feature is a gamified approach to design education. It presents students with design quests and challenges that cross a variety of design disciplines. By using a subjective and open-ended approach, this platform encourages problem-solving, and critical thinking. To improve the learning experience, the platform incorporates educational psychology. Real-time feedback mechanisms are integrated with formative assessment methodologies to give students feedback on their progress. Model-based learning tools, such as concept models, 3D design, and flowcharts are incorporated. This helps students in understanding the connections between ideas, visualising complicated design concepts, and applying their learning to real-world situations. Gamification components such as point systems and prizes help to increase motivation and engagement. The platform aims to combine Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual reality (VR) technology into the concept. Students will be able to explore design environments and develop interesting concepts. This advancement will increase the depth and interaction of the learning experience. Primary research was conducted with preliminary prototypes of the platform with students of design to recognise the initial impact of the features of the platform. This showed to improve design thinking and problem-solving abilities. Prototype concepts have been discussed to further develop the platform’s capabilities. These concepts include the development of a mobile application to facilitate skill tracking and daily design challenges to encourage innovation. In essence, this design learning platform provides a systemic approach to design education, combining various design methods and principles, educational psychology techniques, and AR and VR technology. It hopes to empower design students by providing them with the skills, information, and drive they need to flourish in the dynamic and ever-changing world of design.}

They provide critical data during scenarios ranging from e.g., disaster response to in-home healthcare. However, for these devices to work effectively, end-to-end security schemes for the device communication protocols have to be flexible and should depend upon the application requirements as well as the resource constraints at the network-edge. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a flexible IoT security middleware for end-to-end cloud–fog communications involving smart devices and cloud-hosted applications. The novel features of our middleware are in its ability to cope with intermittent network connectivity as well as device constraints in terms of computational power, memory, energy, and network bandwidth. To provide security during intermittent network conditions, we use a ‘Session Resumption’ algorithm in order for our middleware to reuse encrypted sessions from the recent past, if a recently disconnected device wants to resume a prior connection that was interrupted. In addition, we describe an ‘Optimal Scheme Decider’ algorithm that enables our middleware to select the best possible end-to-end security scheme option that matches with a given set of device constraints. Experiment results show how our middleware implementation also provides fast and resource-aware security by leveraging static properties i.e., static pre-shared keys (PSKs) for a variety of IoT-based application requirements that have trade-offs in higher security or faster data transfer rates.}

abstract = {Although universities typically focus on academic activities, it has become common for several entrepreneurial activities to also occur within university walls. This article aims to unveil how university-based entrepreneurship - or ‘academic intrapreneurship’ - develops dynamically over time. Building on a qualitative case study of a European university, we show how academic intrapreneurship advances through two interconnected processes: a process of academic exploration, and a process of entrepreneurial exploitation. We lay bare how these processes are underpinned by contrasting institutional logics and how navigating them requires academics to handle four specific logic conflicts: (i) a conflict of motivation; (ii) a conflict of organization; (iii) a conflict of orientation; and (iv) a conflict of dissemination. These observations result in three key contributions. First, while academic intrapreneurship is often considered in a static capacity, our study shows that it is decidedly time-dependent. Second, by illustrating how these dynamics draw on the reconciliation of conflicting logics, this article exhibits how academic intrapreneurship finds itself paradoxically driven by the contradictions resting at its core. Finally, to navigate intrapreneurial dynamics successfully, this paper suggests that individuals, universities, and policy makers must all actively balance the modalities of both an academic and an entrepreneurial logic within their institutional practices.}

abstract = {The open and massive characteristics of Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) lead to a lack of instructor presence, which potentially hinders learners' commitment and learning processes. As a result, the effectiveness of MOOCs is contingent upon the extent to which learners direct their own learning. However, learners' self-directed learning and commitment are largely influenced by course design factors due to lack of direct learner-instructor interactions. In order to address the current gap in the literature with regard to how course design factors influence learning processes and outcomes, this study investigated the relationships between MOOC design factors, learner commitment, self-directed learning, and intentions for future learning, using survey responses collected from 664 learners who took a large-scale MOOC. We found that the transactional distance between learners and content was associated with students' self-directed learning. Course structure and organization predicted both students' self-directed learning and commitment to the MOOC. Importantly, self-directed learning mediated relationships between the course design factors and learners’ intentions for further learning. Based on our findings, we provide design strategies for effective learner-content interaction in large-scale self-paced MOOCs.}

abstract = {The covid-19 pandemic has changed people's daily lives and behaviors all across the world and has impacted practically every element of human existence. The introduction of remote education systems and the move toward online learning have had some of the most significant effects. The on-site operations of educational institutions, such as schools, colleges, and universities, have had to be suspended in order to stop the virus' spread. In order to effectively disseminate instructional material and guarantee the unbroken progression of students' academic endeavors, educators have been forced to look for novel approaches. The study used the Value-Based Adoption Model (VAM) as a conceptual framework to look into the factors that affected Kuwait's e-learning outcomes in the midst of the covid-19 pandemic. 382 students at Kuwaiti universities and colleges were the source of quantitative data collection. The findings revealed that peer interaction emerged as the most influential factor in shaping outcomes within the educational context of Kuwait, while instructors and course design factors were not significant. Using the VAM, this study investigated the impact of several factors on students' e-learning results during times of crisis. The research expands the existing knowledge base in the field on this subject and suggests developing a well-organized online learning crisis approach. The main contribution of this work is summarized on (i) An integrated framework for the quality of the e-learning experience in universities in post-covid-19 times and (ii) A resilient higher education institutional learning strategy model in post-covid-19 times. The findings of this paper can be generalizable to other Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) countries such as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Oman. This is due to the shared cultural traditions and values, along with similar educational systems among these nations.}

Recently, reference architectures and models have emerged as instruments suitable to help company’s decision-makers to cope with such tensions. However, whilst many of such architectural models already exist for several industries, little has been done so far in higher education. In this paper, we briefly review major existing developments in such way before to inductively derive a unified information systems reference model tailored for higher education institutions.}

abstract = {Effective student attendance management in higher educational institutions represents a big challenge for faculty members that need fast and accurate approaches. The traditional attendance manual approach is prone to spoofing and wasting a lot of faculty/students time and poor accuracy especially in the case of large student numbers. This paper presents an effective solution for the real-time student attendance management problem in large lecture halls. Fast response time and high accuracy imply using high-speed technologies and processes for student identification. In this paper, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and novel face recognition and identification approaches have been proposed and evaluated. A multimodal approach for student identification combined the power of both the traditional RFID approach and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) index. Capturing the authentic face variability from a sequence of video frames has been considered for the recognition of faces and resulted in system robustness against the variability of facial features. Experimental results indicated an improvement in the performance of the proposed system compared to the state-of-the-art approaches at a rate between 2% and 5%. In addition, it decreased the time three times if compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, such as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Finally, it achieved an accuracy of 99%.}

abstract = {In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process.}

Edge computing brings the computing power at the edge of the network and closer to mobile learning actors. This study investigates the potentials of emerging computing paradigms and proposes a novel mobile edge-based hierarchical architecture to optimize m-learning performance efficiency. The architecture's design follows the ETSI MEC ISG framework and ISG MEC technical requirements. An m-learning use case was executed to evaluate the architecture's performance efficiency in a university facility. The implementation results show reduced latencies and quick response time. The architecture handles data locally on-site, lowers demand on radio access bandwidth, increases confidential data privacy, and continues the application execution even the network is disrupted. The architecture is open to redesign, reconfigure, and integrate with other computing paradigms. IoT-based m-learning use cases should be considered by reflecting learners' scaling of resource needs. Execution of complex use cases will expand the architecture base, MEC-based learning models usage, and change learning-teaching dynamics across educational disciplines.}

AI-clone videos were generated using voice cloning, face swapping, lip-syncing, and body-language simulation, refining the repetition, filler words, and pronunciation of participants' original presentations. The results, viewed through the lens of social comparison theory, showed that AI clones functioned as positive “role models” for encouraging positive social comparisons. Regarding self-perceptions, speech qualities, and self-kindness, the self-recording group showed an increase in pronunciation satisfaction. However, the AI-clone group exhibited greater self-kindness, a wider scope of self-observation, and a meaningful transition from a corrective to an enhancive approach in self-critique. Moreover, machine-rated scores revealed immediate performance gains only within the AI-clone group. Considering individual differences, aligning interventions with participants’ regulatory focus significantly enhanced their learning experience. These findings highlight the theoretical, practical, and ethical implications of AI clones in supporting emotional and cognitive skill development.}

The research questions focused on differences and distinguishing characteristics of autistic and neurotypical usage characteristics in terms of behavior sequences, object associations, and common patterns, and the extent to which the predictability and variability of findings might distinguish the two participant groups and provide provisional insights into the dynamics of their usage behaviors. Findings from entropy analysis suggest the neurotypical group showed greater homogeneity and predictability, and the autistic group displayed significant heterogeneity and variability in behavior. Results from the Markov Chains analysis revealed distinct engagement patterns, with autistic participants exhibiting a wide range of transition probabilities, suggesting varied SVVR engagement strategies, and with the neurotypical group demonstrating more predictable behaviors. Sequential pattern mining results indicated that the autistic group engaged with a broader spectrum of classes within the SVVR environment, hinting at their attraction to a diverse set of stimuli. This research provides a preliminary foundation for future studies in this area, as well as practical implications for designing effective SVVR learning interventions for autistic individuals.}

abstract = {Nowadays, students are encouraged to learn via online learning systems to promote students' autonomy. Scholars have found that students' self-regulated actions impact their academic success in an online learning environment. However, because traditional online learning systems cannot personalize feedback to the student's personality, most students have less chance to obtain helpful suggestions for enhancing their knowledge linked to their learning problems. This paper incorporated self-regulated online learning in the Physics classroom and used a personalized learning approach to help students receive proper learning paths and material corresponding to their learning preferences. This study conducted a quasi-experimental design using a quantitative approach to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed learning environment in secondary schools. The experimental group of students participated in self-regulated online learning with a personalized learning approach, while the control group participated in conventional self-regulated online learning. The experimental results showed that the experimental group's post-test and the learning-gain score of the experimental group were significantly higher than those of the control group. Moreover, the results also suggested that the student's perceptions about the usefulness of learning suggestions, ease of use, goal setting, learning environmental structuring, task strategies, time management, self-evaluation, impact on learning, and attitude toward the learning environment are important predictors of behavioral intention to learn with the self-regulated online learning that integrated with the personalized learning approach.}

abstract = {Emerging systems for tabletop interaction have the potential to support small groups of students in collaborative learning activities. We argue that these devices have the potential to support learning by exploiting the interaction data that they can capture. The capture, analysis and presentation of these data can provide new ways to gain understanding of the collaborative processes. This is particularly important for teachers at two levels. First, they can gain a deeper level of awareness of the progress of individual students and groups in their class and, based on this, make real-time informed decisions. Second, they can do post-hoc reflection and analyse aspects of the class. This paper presents Tabletop-Supported Collaborative Learning (TSCL), a conceptual model that provides foundations for building tabletop-based systems that can inform understanding of the collaborative learning process. The model provides guidance for building the infrastructure to: (i) capture traces of student activity; (ii) exploit these through data analytics techniques; and (iii) provide useful information about the collaborative processes. We illustrate the usefulness of TSCL in its use to create a learning environment that was evaluated in two studies conducted in tertiary education contexts. The first was a laboratory study, where 60 students in 20 groups worked on a concept mapping task, with data from their interaction used to create visualisations of the group processes. The second study was conducted in-the-wild, involving 140 students, working in 8 class sessions.}

This study investigates the role of SRL in acquiring technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), an important aspect of teachers' effective technology use. The present study identified several regulatory procedural patterns used by teachers in the context of their TPACK achievements. A computer-based context, nBrowser, was used to facilitate teachers lesson planning around technology usage. Teachers log file data were analyzed using process mining approaches. Findings indicate that high TPACK performers are more likely to perform self-regulative activities (e.g., monitoring) in developing TPACK compared to the low performers. Higher TPACK performers are more goal-oriented, demonstrate more monitoring and are more iterative in using all SRL processes in contrast to low performers who only partially regulate their problem solving. Such findings support previous research. This study adopts a novel approach for understanding the relations between SRL and TPACK. It offers opportunities to examine how teachers enact SRL as they move from the beginning to later stages of designing lessons and provides insights to researchers who study SRL in TPACK domains. Furthermore, the findings can assist educational designers in developing interventions for promoting TPACK development by concentrating on teachers’ SRL abilities.}

Multiple smart city initiatives and services such as Smart Grid and Smart Meters have emerged that have led to the accumulation of massive amounts of energy big data. Big data is typically characterized by five distinct features namely, volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value. To gain insights and to monetize big data, data has to be collected, stored, processed, analyzed, mined, and visualized. This paper identifies the primary layers of a big data architecture with start-of-the-art communication, storage, and processing technologies that can be utilized to gain meaningful insights and intelligence from big data. In addition, this paper gives an in-depth overview for research and development who intend to explore the various techniques and technologies that can be implemented for harnessing big data value utilizing the recent big data specific processing and visualization tools. Finally, a use case model utilizing the above mentioned technologies for Smart Grid is presented to demonstrate the energy big data road map from generation to monetization. Our key findings highlight the significance of selecting the appropriate big data tools and technologies for each layer of big data architecture, detailing their advantages and disadvantages. We pinpoint the critical shortcomings of existing works, particularly the lack of a unified framework that effectively integrates these layers for smart city applications. This gap presents both a challenge and an opportunity for future research, suggesting a need for more holistic and interoperable solutions in big data management and utilization.}

The current study presents a novel instructional approach that blends a traditional lab experience with a serious educational game (SEG) to engage students with the hands-on laboratory experience while examining the molecular level mechanisms that cause the phenomena. We conducted a mixed methods study to examine teacher use of the blended reality environment (BRE) that utilizes a real-time data capture system and the learning gains associated with use of the BRE with chemistry students (n = 578) in a public high school in the southeast. The results demonstrate that students who experienced the blended reality environment (a) experienced significantly higher learning gains than students who experienced the business as usual (BAU) condition and (b) improved on specific scientific practices outlined in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by practicing science skills in an authentic environment as scientists do. Analysis also reveals the explanatory power of examining student interaction within the BRE. Thematic analysis of teacher interviews identified three strengths of the BRE environment: (a) a coherent explanation of scientific phenomena, (2) an authentic science inquiry, and (3) a connection between the student and teacher within the learning environment.}

But research on personalized feedback following a mastery assessment is scarce and yielded ambiguous effects. Therefore, this study seeks to contribute to this area of research by investigating the effect of two different feedback messages in short online courses for German and English language grammar and spelling in secondary classrooms (grades 6–10). The study compares a reward-based feedback message to a self-referenced feedback message. The reward-based message indicates if the learner reaches the mastery criterion and how many points the learning app awarded for completing the test. The self-referenced feedback message applies motivation theory to strengthen students' internal attribution of causes for the test performance. The web-app MasteryX (www.masteryx.de) randomly assigned students to either the reward-based or the self-referenced feedback message. The study sampled 620 students (309 female, 311 male) in 53 classrooms from 27 secondary schools. It analyzed the effect of the two types of feedback messages on the level of test-retest-sequences (n = 2450). Results indicate small though significant positive effects of the self-referenced feedback message on subsequent learning behavior (reading elaborated item feedback, training behavior). However, a multilevel regression model showed small to medium effects of the reward-based feedback message on the higher course levels' follow-up mastery assessment score. The findings emphasize the complexity of designing personalized feedback strategies in online learning environments with mastery assessments.}

The second student was Self-Monitoring, revisiting his own posts multiple times, checking the discussion frequently for replies, and replying to or editing his posts in response. Finally, the third student was Independent, using the forum as a tool for her own individual reflection.

Experiments conducted on Moodle page views of actual materials collected during actual lessons found that the table visualizes both overall and individual viewpoints.

This paper intends to give an overview of empirical studies on technology-enhanced SRLL interventions on three aspects: (a) how is technology incorporated into SRLL interventions; (b) how effective are technology-enhanced SRLL interventions; and (c) what instructional design features are critical. The review was based on 57 empirical studies from 2012 to 2024. The review revealed three types of technology-enhanced SRLL interventions: technology-supplemented SRLL intervention (i.e., technology as a space for immersive SRLL practice to supplement SRLL strategy training), technology-delivered SRLL intervention (i.e., technology as a tool for delivering SRLL strategy training), and technology-amplified SRLL intervention (i.e., technology as a pedagogical amplifier of SRLL practice without providing strategy training). The effect of technology-enhanced SRLL interventions on SRL and second language learning, although positive in general, varied across the three types. Different design features are essential to the three types too. The review generated a framework of critical design features for each type of technology-enhanced SRLL intervention.}

In this paper, we analyze learners’ interactions with a gamified learning environment to study learners’ engagement in this particular context and to identify the factors that influence engaged behaviors. We also analyze the complex relationships that exist between learners’ engagement and motivation. We conducted a large-scale field study in ecological conditions, involving 257 students (13-14 years’ old) in 12 classes, from 4 different middle schools. We identified a model of engagement that distinguishes two types of engaged behaviors: an achievement-oriented engagement for initially intrinsically motivated learners or high achiever learners, and a perfection-oriented engagement for low achiever learners. We show that each type of engaged behavior has a specific impact on the variation in learners’ motivation during the learning activity. This model contributes to a better understanding of how gamification can affect learners’ engaged behaviors and motivation during the learning activity according to their initial motivation and player profile. These findings open up new perspectives in terms of motivational affordances, as well as the design and dynamic adaptation of gamification based on learners’ interaction traces with the learning environment.}

Here, we use the ATMSG to redesign an existing learning game, Stop & Think (S&T), which was created to train children to apply their inhibitory control skills when solving counterintuitive mathematics and science problems. S&T was previously found to be effective at increasing science and mathematics achievement when the activity was led by a teacher in the classroom. However, we sought to modify its design for use by children in an independent learning scenario (e.g., homeschooling). This work contributes to the literature by demonstrating how the ATMSG was used iteratively during the redesign of S&T for use in a child-led context. We found the ATMSG useful for (i) identifying design gaps created by removing the teacher from the gaming activity, thereby outlining areas of the game requiring modification, (ii) ideation to facilitate discussion about how different design ideas would impact the structure of the game and the feasibility of the approach, (iii) negotiating design decisions between team members, communicating proposed changes in the design amongst stakeholders, seeking approval from project leaders, and serving as a design document for developers, and (iv) cataloguing changes made to the game throughout the redesign process, thereby archiving versions of the game which can be used to reflect upon how each version might impact counterintuitive reasoning. Yet, we also found some challenges in using the ATMSG, including its lack of ability to represent non-structural design decisions (e.g., visual strategies, adaptivity), its impractical format for representing more complex games, and its time-consuming nature.}

To explore the big data generated from a huge amount of learners’ micro-behaviors as the user behavior features for establishing a good CMCCFM, this study developed the learning micro-behavior classification structure according to the collected data features and the concepts of CMC competence. Additionally, an effective method for constructing a CMCCFM with high correctness and stableness was proposed and examined its forecasting effectiveness. The effects of learning situations on the prediction accuracy of CMCCFM were also explored. Analytical results show that the CMCCFM developed by the five considered machine learning schemes all have good prediction performance to some degree. Among the five considered machine learning schemes, the sequence minimum optimization regression algorithm with the model complexity parameter set to 0.1 has the highest prediction accuracy and stability. The key features that influence the prediction accuracy most are “communication behavior” and “communication objective.” Moreover, the development of the CMCCFM must consider the learning situations and learners’ traits, such as discussion trait and familiar degree with the problem-solving subject, because those would affect the prediction accuracy of the developed CMCCFM.}

The ubiquity of AI has led to an increasing demand to integrate AI learning experiences into K-12 education. Early learning experiences incorporating AI concepts and practices are critical for students to better understand, evaluate, and utilize AI technologies. AI planning is an important class of AI technologies in which an AI-driven agent utilizes the structure of a problem to construct plans of actions to perform a task. Although a growing number of efforts have explored promoting AI education for K-12 learners, limited work has investigated effective and engaging approaches for delivering AI learning experiences to elementary students. In this article, we propose a visual interface to enable upper elementary students (grades 3–5, ages 8–11) to formulate AI planning tasks within a game-based learning environment. We present our approach to designing the visual interface as well as how the AI planning tasks are embedded within narrative-centered gameplay structured around a Use-Modify-Create scaffolding progression. Further, we present results from a study of upper elementary students using the visual interface. We discuss how the Use-Modify-Create approach supported student learning as well as discuss the misconceptions and usability issues students encountered while using the visual interface to formulate AI planning tasks.}

This synthesis concludes with a call for an approach to research in data use in education that concurrently engages multiple aspects of the educational system with a focus on multiple levels of theories of learning that address students, teachers, and organizations.}

As such, it serves as an initial ontology for business analytics as a field of study. The foundation has three main parts dealing with the whence and whither of business analytics: identification of dimensions along which business analytics possibilities can be examined, derivation of a six-class taxonomy that covers business analytics perspectives in the literature, and design of an inclusive framework for the field of business analytics. In addition to unifying the literature, a major contribution of the designed framework is that it can stimulate thinking about the nature, roles, and future of business analytics initiatives. We show how this is done by deducing a host of unresolved issues for consideration by researchers, practitioners, and educators. We find that business analytics involves issues quite aside from data management, number crunching, technology use, systematic reasoning, and so forth.}

abstract = {Learning social skills is an important part of the socialisation process of children, which should occur at school, at home and in any place where children live. There are very few studies on social interaction and collaboration roles with 3–4 year old. In this paper, we aim to understand collaboration in young children to help them develop their social skills and improve their overall development. To get this, we have designed an observational experiment to monitor and characterise group activity and roles, mediated by technology and using data mining techniques. First, we have designed a game as a free-play situation where the conditions require interplay of three children with toys and among interaction among peers. Children interacts with game through tangible toys. The environment collects accurate data on children’s actions automatically and non-intrusively. We also consider other data from direct observation by psychologists and educators. Then, we have organised a study for groups(triads) of 3 to 4-year-old children playing with this game. We analyse data from 81 children (51.9% boys and 48.1% girls) in groups of three randomly selected. The work proposes a set of actions in the game and from them a set of indicators, which are used as intermediate measures of observation to analyse the playing process. Social interaction is characterised in 5 levels: Coordination, Cooperation, Collaboration, Troubled and Unproductive; and five roles: Saboteur, Missing, Explorer, Actor, Collaborator and Director. We found that children interact socially, engage in play, help each other and mostly reach the level of collaboration. There are minority cases of non-cooperation (Troubled or Unproductive), with conflict situations or trial and error solving processes, which cause the task to last a long time before it is finally finished. We have also found that children can adopt different roles in the group. Occasionally, there are cases of children who act as conductors, organising the work while others follow. This work provides a contribution for teachers and educators in the preschool classroom, relating to social interaction. It tells us that young children can play in randomly organised groups, collaborate and take roles, help their peers and learn to do so in classroom games. It shows a learning situation that can serve as an example of how to conduct technology-mediated activities in the classroom to promote social interaction among children in an effective, engaging and motivating way.}

Although research on SRL is expanding in recent years, much of the literature has relied on self-reporting tools to measure SRL. Online trace data analysis, an emerging approach, provides the promise of greater authenticity and convenience in measuring SRL as compared to self-reports. We conducted a systematic review of online trace data analysis that measured SRL in various learning platforms to address three research questions: “How did previous studies use online trace data as indicators of SRL?“, “What approaches are being used to interpret the online trace data?“, and “What are the challenges of using online trace data to measure SRL?“. We systematically searched seven bibliographic databases with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 38 empirical studies were eventually examined. We leveraged the two most cited SRL models as theoretical basis and mapped the various online trace data into relevant SRL process to answer the first research question. Two commonly adopted approaches to interpret the online trace data were identified. Three key challenges pertaining to the use of trace data to measure SRL were identified: time segmentation, generalization, and validity. We discussed these challenges and the possible means to mitigate them. Finally, we propose a flowchart to guide future studies in conducting online trace data analysis in SRL research.}

In informal learning, foreign language learners often struggle to memorize new vocabularies, and therefore, new tools need to be developed to facilitate vocabulary acquisition. In computer-assisted learning environments, images are often used as annotations to represent words because images convey the essence of a word more effectively than verbal descriptions. Also, understanding the learning contexts in which learning happens is crucial for any computer-assisted learning environment. From this standpoint, in this research, a context-aware language learning app called Wordhyve is developed. Wordhyve, a native Android app, is built to support foreign language learners in memorizing foreign vocabularies using multimedia annotations, including images, texts, translation, voices, and contextual clues. Wordhyve allows language learners to capture and record lifelogs. Later on, the app uses those learning experiences as triggers to enhance foreign vocabularies. The analytics of the Wordhyve use those logs for the recommendation of incidental vocabularies and assist learners in memorizing those recommended vocabularies using various learning contexts. Wordhyve uses image analytics on the learner-captured images to recommend those incidental vocabularies.}

Human-in-the-loop research predominantly examines the interaction types and effects. A more structural and pragmatic exploration of humans and Artificial Intelligence or AI is lacking in the AI in education literature.
Purpose
In this systematic review, we follow the Entity-Relationship (ER) framework to identify trends in the entities, relationships, and attributes of human-in-the-loop AI in education.
Methods
An overview of N = 28 reviewed studies followed by their ER characteristics are summarized and analyzed.
Results
The dominant number of two or three-entity studies, one-sided relationships, few attributes, and many to many cardinalities may signal a lack of deliberation on beings that come to interact and influence human-in-the-loop and AI in education.
Conclusion
The contribution of this work is identifying the implications of human-in-the-loop and AI from a more formal ER perspective and acknowledging the many possibilities for placement of humans in the loop with the AI, system, and environment of interest.}

The BDVMFF offers the teacher a digital workflow to effectively exchange both the writing and the input to use multimodal feedback effectively. This system provides teachers and students with an effective and straightforward digital learning environment.

In this study, we investigate whether limiting effort avoidance improves learning outcomes. We also examine differences in learning outcomes for a substantive typology of students: toilers (practice many problems), skippers (skip many problems), and rushers (provide fast responses). In a large-scale computer adaptive practice system for primary education, over 1 50 000 participants were distributed across four conditions in which a problem-skipping option was delayed by 0, 3, 6, or 9 s. The results show that after a 14-week period, there are no average treatment effects on learning outcomes across conditions. Also, no consistent conditional average treatment effects are found across the typology. However, different types of students have different learning outcomes, showing that the typology used is meaningful. We conclude that the scale of the experiment suggests a precise null finding, but caution that this should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect. Problem-skipping restrictions may require a longer-lasting implementation to accumulate the desired effect.}

abstract = {Over a decade after the Article 29 Working Party first stated that data controllers should refrain from the processing of children’s data for the purpose of behavioural advertising, children are still profiled at scale for commercial purposes, including behavioural advertising. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (‘UNCRC’) Committee urges States parties to prohibit profiling children for commercial purposes, as the practice is associated with a panoply of potential children’s rights violations and may cause children significant harm. Yet little scholarship is devoted to seeking granularity in defining what “profiling for commercial purposes” entails. The present article seeks to fill this gap and presents a new taxonomy of the various manifestations in which the commercial profiling of children occurs. This is followed by a children’s rights-based assessment of the six distinguishable manifestations of children’s commercial profiling, highlighting the importance of nuance in the academic and regulatory discourse on the subject. Whereas profiling children to directly monetise their personal data interferes with several children’s rights and likely causes children significant harm (although full scientific evidence thereupon is still lacking), in certain use cases profiling children for indirect commercial purposes may contribute to the exercise of their rights and wellbeing. The article subsequently assesses the EU regulatory framework governing the various manifestations of children’s commercial profiling through the prism of the precautionary principle, a general principle of EU law that justifies the regulation of a practice in the face of scientific uncertainty on the (long-term) harm it may cause. In the field of children’s rights, a strong precautionary approach is the norm, mandating the prohibition of practices that pose (unacceptable levels of) risk to children. The analysis dissects the relevant provisions in the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (‘UCPD’), the Digital Services Act (‘DSA’) and Artificial Intelligence Act (‘AI Act’), to conclude that primarily, yet merely in theory, the GDPR is adequately equipped to uphold children’s rights in this regard, as the fairness and transparency principles that are cornerstones to the GDPR do not allow for the processing of children’s data in the context of the vast majority of children’s commercial profiling practices that remain omnipresent to date.}

abstract = {Background and objective
This paper presents an empirical study of a gamified mobile-based assessment approach that can be used to engage students and improve their educational performance.
Method
A gamified audience response system called G-SIDRA was employed. Three gamification elements were used to motivate students in classroom activities: badges for achievements to increase engagement, points to indicate progression and performance in the subject and ranking for promoting competitiveness. A total of 90 medical students in a General and Descriptive Anatomy of the Locomotor System course were taught using G-SIDRA in the academic year 2019/2020. Smart bracelets were configured to collect heart rate measurements from 30 students with the aim of evaluating the impact of the gamification elements. The control group consisted of a sample of 110 students enrolled on the same course in the academic year 2016/2017 using non-gamified SIDRA.
Results
Statistically significant differences were found between multiple choice questions (MCQ) scores obtained by using SIDRA and G-SIDRA in the four experiments (U = 1.621,50, p < 0,01 for Exp1; U = 1.950,00, p < 0,01 for Exp2; U = 955,00, p < 0,01 for Exp3; U = 2.335,00, p < 0,01 for Exp4). In the students’ final exam grades, statistically significant differences between students that used G-SIDRA as opposed to SIDRA (T(157) = 3.992; p = 0.044) were obtained. Concerning gamification elements, statistically significantly differences were found in comparing the pulse increases after and before the badge event in the four experiments (U = 2.484,00, p = 0,038 for Exp1; U = 2.109,50, p = 0,046 for Exp2; U = 1.790,50, p = 0,025 for Exp3; U = 1.557,0, p = 0,048 for Exp4). However, there are not statistically significant differences between the pulse increases after and before the ranking event in the four experiments. In a 5-point Likert-type scale, the students expressed satisfaction with G-SIDRA (M = 4.552) and thought the system helped to better understand both theoretical and practical concepts (M = 4.092). Their global assessment of the G-SIDRA platform was 4.471.
Conclusions
Of the three gamification elements used in the study, only badge has an effect on heart rate. Better student responses and academic performance were achieved when using G-SIDRA. Nevertheless, more research is required to evaluate the impact of the gamification elements on the motivation, engagement and performance of students. Physiological measures are promising approaches for gamification elements evaluation.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a transformative force across diverse sectors worldwide, with policy initiatives signalling its rising prominence. In the realm of education, AI holds promise for revolutionising learning and teaching. However, the incorporation of AI in basic education faces significant challenges for many schools, particularly when explicit curriculum guidelines are absent, and teachers have limited exposure to AI technologies. This study delves into the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED), particularly in primary and secondary school settings, with a specific emphasis on the obstacles and facilitators. The research examines the impact of digital leadership and its role in mitigating teachers' barriers to AIED incorporations. These external variables are systematically outlined within the conceptual framework proposed by this study. Furthermore, it conceptualises and considers three AIED approaches—Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI—as internal variables central to basic-education AIED incorporations, as highlighted in previous research. The study gathers quantitative data through a self-constructed questionnaire survey from 204 school principals and management-level teachers across 60 primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, capturing their perceptions of AIED incorporation. A structural equation model (SEM) is adopted to analyse the relationships between digital leadership, internal and external teacher barriers, and the three AIED approaches. The findings underscore that digital leadership is a significant factor in facilitating AI incorporations in schools, and that teachers' internal and external barriers considerably affect Learning about AI. The paper concludes by proposing strategies to enhance the capabilities of school leaders and teachers in promoting AIED in basic education.}

Regrettably, numerous industries are still reluctant to benefit from the opportunities that exist on energy saving and consciousness, due to inadequate knowledge on energy management, resources and tools to monitor the losses. Based on these facts, this paper proposed the Energy Efficiency Analysis Modelling System (EEAMS) as a tool to provide an estimate of energy costs using rail car manufacturing plant load profiles as a case study, to provide consumer-oriented analysis to produce first-cut energy efficient program baseline costs. Furthermore, the exploration of energy efficiency baseline may benefit the life cycle cost of the overall proposed facility through energy efficient means of production, and continuous improvement practises in big data analytics towards reduction of energy costs significantly through integration of energy efficiency software (EES). To achieve this, a bottom-up approach methodology was adopted, using information on energy cost as a baseline to allow centralisation and cloud hosting of data through a web-based interacting energy efficiency sustainability framework platform, to determine the economic impacts of energy measurement and verification on energy consumption and environment.

abstract = {The Digital Education Index for Developing Countries (DEIFDC) is a compound index that considers nine different variables grouped in three main levers that have been researched relevant to assess the overall state of readiness of Digital Education deployment in a developing country. Digital Education has been approached from an instrumental point of view, focusing on the advantages that the introduction at an early stage of digital tools brings to the teaching and learning processes to ensure children can acquire the required 21st competencies of a future workforce. In the application for the Indian case, social, cultural, economic and educational data obtained through desk research during the first semester of 2021 has been taken into consideration. Despite significant Government efforts on scaling up Digital Education, primarily due to the Covid-19 pandemic school closure, the 0.596 DEIFDC score on a 0–1 possible range has shown Inadequate Digital Education Deployment, derived mainly from poor school infrastructure, limited pedagogical capabilities and modest students' skills. Furthermore, the socio-demographic differences observed among school children and the existent digital divide in rural and urban areas demonstrate that major effort needs to be undertaken to ensure vulnerable Indian population does not lag behind under the new rules of the Digital Economy.}

There is a solid research base showing the positive impact that games can have on learning, and useful methods in educational data mining. However, there is still much to be explored in terms of what the results of gameplay data analysis can tell stakeholders and how those results can be used to improve learning. As one step toward addressing this, researchers in this study collected back-end data from high school students as they played an MMOG called The Radix Endeavor. Data from a specific genetics quest in the game were analyzed by using data mining techniques including the classification tree method. These techniques were used to examine the relationship between tool use and quest completion, how use of certain tools may influence content-related game choices, and the multiple pathways available to players in the game. The study identified that in this quest use of the trait examiner tool was most likely to lead to success, though a greater number of trait decoder tool uses could also lead to success, perhaps because in those cases players solving problems about genetic traits at an earlier point. These results also demonstrate the multiple strategies available to Radix players that provide different pathways to quest completion. Given these methods of analysis and quest-specific results, the study applies the findings to suggest ways to validate and refine the game design, and to provide useful feedback to students and teachers. The study suggests ways that analysis of gameplay data can be part of a feedback loop to improve a digital learning experience.}

Our aim is to better understand the relation between: community members' motivations in participating in these types of communities, their behavior within the community used as part of their training, as well as the quality of their learning design contributions. Two iterations of data gathering (several sources) were performed with a total of 91 participants. They reported their motivations to participate in these types of communities through questionnaires. Log data from their use of a particular platform was collected to quantify the behavioral engagement and the quality of the shared learning designs. Furthermore, the assessment of experts was also gathered as an additional measure of quality. A cross-case analysis leads us to problematize previous work suggesting relations between self-reported motivations and participants’ behavior within the community, or with the quality of their contributions. In contrast, the results show that behavior and the contributions' quality are affected by the incentives and the features implemented in the supporting platform of the online community. The study results have practical implications for teacher OC platforms, for example about the importance of offering and using features that provide self-awareness indicators about their actions and the quality of their contributions.}

What kinds of capabilities do people need in a world infused with AI? How can we conceptualise these capabilities? How can we help learners develop them? How can we empirically study and assess their development? With this paper, we open the discussion by adopting a dialogical knowledge-making approach. Our team of 11 co-authors participated in an orchestrated written discussion. Engaging in a semi-independent and semi-joint written polylogue, we assembled a pool of ideas of what these capabilities are and how learners could be helped to develop them. Simultaneously, we discussed conceptual and methodological ideas that would enable us to test and refine our hypothetical views. In synthesising these ideas, we propose that there is a need to move beyond AI-centred views of capabilities and consider the ecology of technology, cognition, social interaction, and values.}

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) has been the focus of significant attention in recent years because of its growing social importance and pedagogical value. In Hong Kong, an increasing number of K-12 schools are planning or piloting their grassroots AIED incorporation practices. However, progress is reportedly slow due to a number of barriers. Unfortunately, because of their limited scope, disputed interpretations and contextual irrelevance, current research literature seems to be of limited referencing value in aiding schools to address the issues and overcome the barriers. This paper highlights the necessity of embracing AIED as wide-ranging given the current understanding of it as a collective notion. Three major directions of AIED are identified: Learning from AI, Learning about AI, and Learning with AI. A collective case study, which examined the perceived barriers to AIED incorporation in Hong Kong K-12 schools with different AIED directions, was conducted. Qualitative data were gathered via ten semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from two schools. Ertmer’s (1999) typology was applied to segregate the barriers. The findings showed that both first-order and second-order barriers existed, although they varied between the cases. It was also found that the barriers did not hinder in isolation but appeared to be interconnected. The findings suggest that schools use differentiated strategies to tackle barriers according to their approach to incorporating AIED. Moreover, there is a need to trace the links between barriers and prioritise school efforts to remove or reduce them with high linkage. Several recommendations for practice are given.}

The understanding of mutual interdependencies of events and processes is crucial for cybersecurity and software reliability. One of the promising ways to tackle these challenges is process mining, which is a set of techniques that aims to mine essential knowledge from processes, thus providing more perspectives and temporal context to data interpretation and process understanding. However, it is unclear how process mining can help and can be practically used in the context of cybersecurity and reliability. Therefore, in this work, we investigate the potential of process mining to aid in cybersecurity and software reliability to analyze and support research efforts in these areas. Concretely, we collect existing process mining applications, discuss current trends and promising research directions that can be used to tackle the current cybersecurity and software reliability challenges. To this end, we conduct a systematic literature review covering 35 relevant research approaches to examine how the process mining is currently used for these tasks and what are the research gaps and promising research directions in the area. This work is an extension of our previous work, which focused solely on the cybersecurity area, based on the observation of relative closeness and similar goals of those two fields, in which some approaches tend to overlap.}

This is particularly pivotal in developing countries where bridging the gap between entrepreneurial talent demands and the supply from vocational institutions is vital. This study develops a tailored game-theoretic model to examine the interactions between government, entrepreneurs, and vocational education providers. It delves into how lifelong learning shapes entrepreneurial strategies, emphasising institutional innovations by the government and adaptability in enterprises. The model suggests that governments provide lifelong learning policies and support, entrepreneurs adjust their needs strategies in response to business developments, and vocational education institutions deliver skill enhancement programmes. The methodology encompasses analysing how lifelong learning initiatives impact entrepreneurial decisions, risk-taking behaviour, and innovative potential. The study's findings reveal that lifelong learning lowers entry barriers, augments adaptability, and fosters innovation. However, it may also lead to heightened risk aversion, slower decision-making, and overreliance on external support, potentially hindering bold innovation. To mitigate these challenges, governments should devise lifelong learning support schemes that foster innovation and risk management. This study contributes theoretical insights for possible latecomer advantages in developing countries.}

The first entry in our guide is made by a set of visual variables appropriate for representing areal uncertainty in algorithm mechanics. Such visualisations show users how data points are distributed in the classification space and allow them to understand the “goodness-of-fit” of their data to the algorithm. This is important for Visual Analytics applications, which combine Information Visualisation with information mining techniques in an interactive decision-making process. Model uncertainties stemming from widely spread data points need to be visualised so that the user can make adjustments and improve the analysis. To capitalise on established knowledge and meaning, we explore whether popular visual variables for representing areal uncertainty in the domain of geospatial visualisation may also be effective for representing uncertainty in the visualisation of the mechanics of K-means clustering and Linear Regression algorithms, as both use a spatial distribution of data points. In a study with 500 participants we find that overall the visual means opacity performs best, followed by texture, but that grid and blur may be unsuitable for quantifying uncertainty. The performance of contour lines appears to depend on the algorithm visualisation. Using this study, we extend the validity of a set of domain-specific findings from geospatial visualisation to the visualisation of algorithm mechanics and use these to form the first building blocks of a cross-disciplinary visual guide for representing uncertainty, laying promising foundations for future work.}

Edge analytics uses some techniques or algorithms to analyse the data generated by the edge devices. With the emerging of edge analytics, the edge devices have become a complete set. Currently, edge analytics is unable to provide full support to the analytic techniques. The edge devices cannot execute advanced and sophisticated analytic algorithms following various constraints such as limited power supply, small memory size, limited resources, etc. This article aims to provide a detailed discussion on edge analytics. The key contributions of the paper are as follows-a clear explanation to distinguish between the three concepts of edge technology: edge devices, edge computing, and edge analytics, along with their issues. In addition, the article discusses the implementation of edge analytics to solve many problems and applications in various areas such as retail, agriculture, industry, and healthcare. Moreover, the research papers of the state-of-the-art edge analytics are rigorously reviewed in this article to explore the existing issues, emerging challenges, research opportunities and their directions, and applications.}

abstract = {To deal with the current need for flexible learning trajectories giving access to a more diverse group of learners, synchronous hybrid virtual classrooms have been designed to connect both on-site students and remote students during synchronous teaching. Given synchronous blended learning is relatively new, there are only few studies that have investigated its use and effectiveness. Furthermore, the existing literature is mostly exploratory and qualitative in nature. This present study meets the need for empirical, theory-driven research. More specific, this study has set up an experiment to investigate how different learning settings can affect students' relatedness, intrinsic motivation and learning achievement in the context of a synchronous learning space. The Self-Determination Theory (SDT) namely stresses that relatedness is a contributing factor for intrinsic motivation and indirectly also predicts learning achievement. Although there are numerous studies using SDT in various contexts, only limited studies used this theory to examine learning in the hybrid virtual classroom comparing different learning settings and its effects on relatedness, intrinsic motivation and learning achievement. The educational setting depends on whether students are physically present and thus attend the lecture face-to-face (F2F) or remotely (virtual), and on whether the setting is the same for all students (pure) or mixed (hybrid). This study presents the results of an experimental within-subjects design study comparing the students' learning experiences as F2F versus virtual student in the pure or hybrid setting. A mixed-methods approach is used including real-time measurements of intrinsic motivation next to retrospective self-report surveys and interviews. Also the effect of quizzes has been consistently investigated. The results show that although the hybrid virtual classroom is promising regarding flexibility in education as it gives students the choice where to attend the course, it is also the most challenging one to teach in and to learn in as a remote participant. It has been found that both the relatedness to peers and the intrinsic motivation is the lowest in the hybrid-virtual setting. Yet, our results show that launching quizzes is positively related to all students’ motivation. Further research that implements different kinds of quizzes and at different time intervals is necessary to validate this finding in the context of the hybrid virtual classroom. Future research should also investigate how relatedness between the remote students and their on-campus counterparts can be improved by means of instructional interventions.}

Findings suggest AI-enabled talent applications improved individual experiences of talents at this MNE pursuing an innovation strategy. Findings from the data analysis suggest that first, an innovation-led strategy and culture created a social context for sharing of talent-specific knowledge through knowledge-based data systems embedded in talent-focused AI applications. Second, talent-focused knowledge sharing using AI-mediated social exchange applications resulted in talents experiencing varying personalization levels and positive experience in terms of increased job satisfaction and commitment and reduced turnover intentions.

Such a lens implies that forum interactions represent a network of learners with heterogeneous levels of commitment to forum activity. A networked lens helps capture forum communities, so-called forum residents, as well as the rest of the crowd, also known as forum visitors. The current study empirically demonstrates the differences between these forum sub-populations. Building on a large dataset of manually labelled discussion threads in four edX MOOCs, our findings uncover two distinct patterns in the communication of posters with different length of forum commitment. As the courses progressed, all types of communication decreased for forum visitors, but both socio-cognitive and informational queries increased for forum residents. We find that the communication dynamics of committed forum posters cannot be observed when the entire forum population is examined in its entirety. Further, the study profiles learners around discussion type sequences. We show that communication topics of forum visitors appear narrow and topical when compared to the diversity of topics by resident posters. This paper offers a foundation towards the scaling of social teaching practices for personalised learning of both residents and visitors as well as community development in massive open online courses.}

To date, studies on these forms of regulation, especially on cognitive regulation, have explored the temporal and sequential patterns of regulatory processes using various sample sizes, especially in collaborative learning, whereas few studies were found on how different argumentation scaffolds affect the structure of these three types of regulation. With the maturity of cloud computing and 5G technology, many kinds of collaborative whiteboards can be adopted to support students' argumentation. In this study, Toulmin's Argument Pattern (TAP) and Nussbaum's Argument Vee Diagram (AVD) scaffolds were integrated into an online whiteboard to assist with collaborative argumentation. A total of 193 pre-service teachers of five intact classes were recruited and evenly assigned to the control cohort, the TAP cohort and the AVD cohort. This study conducted a quasi-experiment for 6 weeks, collecting pretests on prior instructional design knowledge & prior argumentation skills and individual metacognition as covariates, screen recording of online whiteboard-based argumentation activities, and group argumentative reports. Using MANCOVA and epistemic network analysis (ENA), this study drew the following conclusions: (1) Compared to the conventional discussion, TAP and AVD scaffolds respectively activated prominently more self-regulation and co-regulation. However, in socially shared regulation, there was no significant difference between the two scaffolds and the conventional discussion; (2) The TAP and AVD scaffolds significantly enhanced students' written argument skills compared to the conventional discussion, but no significant difference existed in the TAP and AVD scaffolds for improving students' written argument skills since the AVD scaffold evoked a great deal of ineffective co-regulation; (3) In the claim phase, the TAP scaffold activated a stronger connection between co-regulation and socially shared regulation than the other two scaffolds, while the AVD scaffold had a connection between self-regulation and socially shared regulation that was stronger than the conventional discussion and as strong as the TAP scaffold. In the justification phase, the AVD scaffold showed a far stronger connection between self-regulation and co-regulation, while the TAP scaffold illustrated a stronger connection between co-regulation and socially shared regulation. In the rebuttal phase, all three scaffolds showed the strongest connection between self-regulation and co-regulation. This study has implications for effectively using online whiteboards to support productive argumentation, in turn boosting argumentation skills along with regulation characteristics of productive argumentation.}

abstract = {A high performance data analytics for internet of things (IoT) has been a promising research subject in recent years because traditional data mining algorithms may not be applicable to big data of IoT. One of the main reasons is that the data that need to be analyzed may exceed the storage size of a single machine. The computation cost of data analysis tasks that is too high for a single computer system is another critical problem we have to confront when analyzing data from an IoT system. That is why an efficient data clustering framework for metaheuristic algorithm on a cloud computing environment is presented in this paper for data analytics, which explains how to divide mining tasks of a mining algorithm into different nodes (i.e., the Map process) and then aggregate the mining results from these nodes (i.e., Reduce process). We further attempted to use the proposed framework to implement data clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means, genetic k-means, and particle swarm optimization) on a standalone system and Spark. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed framework makes it useful to develop data clustering algorithms on a cloud computing environment.}

abstract = {Inquiry-based Learning is increasingly suggested as an efficient approach for fostering learners' curiosity and motivation. It helps learners to develop their ability to work in complex and unpredictable environments making them more critical thinkers and agentic learners. Although mobile technology is a suitable support for this learning process, there is a lack of practical strategies for educational practitioners to enact the right balance between enabling agency and supporting the students through the mobile technology. Thus, we conducted a literature review that analyzed 62 studies on mobile inquiry-based learning. The analysis focused on the level of agency supported by mobile technology. This review study provided two main results. The first result is a two-layer classification –with five types and twelve subtypes– of the most common mobile activities used in inquiry-based learning. The types and subtypes are: 1) Direct instruction formed by 1a) location guidance, 1b) procedural guidance and 1c) metacognitive guidance, 2) Access to content formed by 2a) fixed and 2b) dynamic content, 3) Data collection that consists of 3a) cooperative and 3b) collaborative data collection, 4) Peer-to-peer communication formed by 4a) asynchronous and 4b) synchronous social communications and 5) Contextual support that includes 5a) augmented experience, 5b) immersive experience and 5c) adaptive feedback. The second result consists of an analytical framework –based on six dimensions– to assess the level of agency supported by the different types of mobile activities. The learners' agency dimensions are: 1) Goals, 2) Content, 3) Actions, 4) Strategies, 5) Reflection and 6) Monitoring. Finally, the review presents insights on how this analytical framework can be used by educational practitioners to identify mobile activities that effectively balance learners’ agency with mobile technology.}

In the framework of the project, courses have been designed and carried out in three different countries: Italy, Spain and the Netherlands. The paper discusses the main requirements for the courses and presents a table template, based on state of the art models for entrepreneurship education, that we have used for the scouting of the most suited SGs and defining the most appropriate mix for their use in the courses, keeping into account targeted competences and skills, usability and pedagogical effectiveness. Using the template, the paper draws a comprehensive overview of relevant SGs available on the market and identifies, through an expert analysis, key benefits and issues concerning their adoption in teaching entrepreneurship for the target students. Finally, the paper critically analyzes the state of the art, indicating directions for future research that should lead to development of more effective SGs for entrepreneurship education.}

However, multiple questions about the effectiveness of educational games with respect to cognitive and non-cognitive effects remain unclear. The current study, a longitudinal, quasi-experiment with 336 first graders, examined the effects of two digital educational games, Number Sense Game (NSG) and Reading Game (RG). The NSG trained early numerical skills, the RG supported emergent reading. Children were pseudo-randomly assigned to either an experimental condition, comprising eight weeks of intensive game-based training, or a control condition in which they took part in regular education without game-based practice. A pretest-posttest design was used to examine the effects of the intervention on cognitive (digit comparison, number line estimation, letter knowledge, math and reading competence) and non-cognitive outcomes (math and reading anxiety). Delayed cognitive effects on math and reading competence were also investigated two months after the intervention. Furthermore, we examined variances of the impact of the training on cognitive outcomes as a consequence of differences in children's prior knowledge, prior affect and socio-economic status. For cognitive outcomes, results revealed that children who played a game performed better on number line estimation and reading competence, whereas no significant differences were observed for digit comparison, letter knowledge and math competence. Also, children who played a game showed better scores in the delayed reading posttest, but not in the delayed math posttest. For non-cognitive outcomes, game training did not affect math or reading anxiety. Regarding individual differences, children with less prior knowledge in the game play condition performed better on the number line estimation posttest compared to children in the control condition. Children with more prior knowledge in the game play condition still scored better on this test compared to the control condition, but the difference between the conditions was smaller.}

abstract = {While digital technologies are typically used to support established educational roles, they can also enable new roles, providing guidance for learners at previously inaccessible points in the learning process (e.g., at home, on-the-go). This work presents one such role — a technology-assisted human coach — that relies on digital technology to offer a personally-tailored learning experience where children can engage in self-motivated, personally meaningful exploration at home using mobile literacy apps and coaches can scaffold children's learning asynchronously based on their play data. To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of this virtual coaching role, we created two instantiations of a coaching system using open-ended literacy apps. We conducted a randomized controlled trial and a formative study. We found that it is feasible for a novel computer system to assist a human coach in analyzing and supporting children's learning and discussing progress with caregivers to help them co-engage. Our analysis shows that coaches successfully fulfilled their role as designed, and that the coaching system was effective in increasing caregivers' awareness of their children's in-app play and playtime with the literacy app, but not in increasing the variety of words children made. Furthermore, we found that for families with lower formal education levels, the effects of the coaching system were significantly stronger across almost all outcomes investigated. Considering these findings, we contribute guidance on how to create new roles in children's learning enabled by data-driven systems that can reach learners at a traditionally difficult-to-access part of the learning process and support self-motivated learning.}

To comprehend AI’s disruption as well as harness its potential, we conducted a developmental review of 92 scholarly works centred on financial auditing, the chosen professional service domain. Drawing on the corpus of literature, we applied the Technology Affordance and Constraints Theory (TACT) to dissect the opportunities and challenges that AI introduces to professional services. Our analysis led to conceptualising AI’s affordances and constraints for individual practitioners, firms, and professional associations within the auditing domain. Subsequently, we compared these with the affordances and constraints of typical non-AI, classic IT tools in the same domain, highlighting the disruptive essence of AI. Our findings further revealed the reciprocal and tensional relationship between AI affordances and constraints, where actualising AI affordance at the firm level may impose constraints on individual practitioners. Based on our findings, we argue for integrating AI into decision-making by practitioners, propose a dynamic view of task automation and augmentation for firms, and urge an AI-calibrated knowledge system for professional associations. This study contributes to both theory and practice, laying the foundation for a more nuanced discourse on the strategic significance of harnessing AI in professional services.}

abstract = {E-assessment has been supported in Learning Management Systems for decades. More recently, dedicated e-exam systems have emerged on the market, more specifically supporting the workflow and security needs surrounding high stakes exams. For instance, in Norway, LMS's Canvas and Blackboard are only used for ungraded assessment tasks, while e-exam systems like WISEflow and Inspera Assessment are used for graded ones. Since the systems are mass-market software, vendors must satisfy the needs of several customers, and needs that are specific to only one or a few customers will receive low priority, perhaps forcing teachers to adapt their assessments to what the tool supports, rather than having the tool adapt to the preferred pedagogy. So far, there has been considerable research on views of students and teachers on e-exam systems, much less on the views of vendors and managers. In this paper, we investigate what these stakeholder groups consider to be the key features of e-exam systems, and by what process they are determined. An exploratory case study was conducted, based on interviews with 12 participants belonging to three different groups: vendors, process manager and system managers in Norwegian universities. Our findings indicate much agreement among these groups about key features of e-exam systems, though observing that not all functionality requested by end-users will be prioritized. Also, there was much agreement that a movement towards standardization, open interfaces and digital ecosystems would allow smoother integration with other information systems in the higher education sector, and easier addition of plug-ins for specific functionality – but that there still is a way to go to reach the ambitions of a flexible ecosystem. Currently, vendors give more priority for adding functional features in e-exam systems rather than better interoperability, and integration with third-party tools remains a challenge.}

A total of 4,202,974 units of variables (student behaviours and MOOC features) were analysed using Semi-Supervised Extreme Learning Machine (SSELM) and Global Sensitivity Analysis. In this study, the use of SSELM was compared to the state-of-art models (e.g. ELM, KELM, OP-ELM, PCA-ELM), and SSELM yielded 97.24% accuracy. Using unlabelled students helped improve the learning accuracy for the model, which confirms that SSELM is a good model to predict completion in MOOCs, considering the difficulty of labelling students in such an open and flexible learning environment. The findings show that designers and teachers should pay special attention to their students during the second quartile of the course (independently of the type of MOOC). The teachers’ presence during the course, his or her interactions with students and the quality of the videos presented are significant determinants of course completion.}
